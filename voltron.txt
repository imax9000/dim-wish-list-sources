//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Oh this is a spicy roll. Reconstruction and chill clip are so strong together. Subsistence is another good shout if you know you’ll secure the kill. I think dropping the charge time as a quality of life perk will make the whole experience better, but if you are okay with the charge time normally, you can go for a larger magazine."

// Aurvandil FR6
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvP / M+KB): "In PvP there aren't a lot of pros for high-impact fusions. They are certainly strong and they are my favorites to use. But the charge time increase really hurt their overall utility. The change to 5 bolts was nice, but not having high-impact reserves in this weapons perk pool is a bit of a let down. Elemental capacitor can make it feel super consistent on void, arc or stasis. Firmly planted will make the shot you do take incredibly consistent, void or not." Recommended MW - Range.|tags:pvp,mkb

// Lodbrok-C
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "High-impact frame autos feel weird. They shoot too slow for my liking but their damage is incredible. They can chew through rank-and-file enemies with ease, but their low magazine size handicaps them. The best thing to do is try and work around the low magazine by bumping it up or bypassing it entirely. Doing both with appended mag and demolitionist might give you the best bang for your buck. Add on adrenaline junkie for the damage boost and you have a pretty solid weapon. Osmosis will help with elemental wells and general subclass synergy. Cascade point and target lock are interesting. I think on a high-damage primary like Lodbrok-C either could work really well. Cascade point will increase your RPM and target lock will increase your damage. Either way you’re doing more damage to majors and chunky enemies." Recommended MW - Reload.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

Add in some juiced up stats and range and you can compete with some of the more meta weapons. You can realistically hit 100 range which will put you at a whopping 40m of in-game range.

This does mean that the grenades can split off and you’d only be doing half damage. The double grenades do have two impact damages which does put them ahead of regular grenade launchers. Auto-loading holster is still the best for fire-and-forget. Disruption break is always going to be a strong pick, especially on impacts for demolishing shields. Frenzy and vorpal can work if you’re primarily going to be using Wilderflight as your main source of damage instead of setting up yourself or your team for kinetic damage."

// Disparity
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Disparity is probably the best weapon to come out of the season. A craftable aggressive burst pulse rifle that looks good, feels good, has a fantastic sight [...]. There are so many great perks to go for but the base will all be the same. Arrowhead to have near-perfect recoil direction. Flared magwell or tactical mag for a bump in reload / stability with the latter having a slight bump in magazine. Rapid hit is my preferred third column option but outlaw is easier and immediate. No need to build up stacks, just headshot and done. Frenzy is the immediate choice for a “no thoughts, head empty” workhorse weapon. Headstone and desperado are both fantastic for their respective builds. The former gives you slow, cover, and stasis synergy, while the latter gives you that Rambo effect turning your pulse into a mini machine gun." Recommended MW - Stability.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

Kill clip is the easiest to use and helps make the second kill easier as you won’t need as many critical hits. Headseeker is my pick for overall neutral play.

It can roll the infamous roll of dragonfly and explosive head, with the newly buffed dragonfly it should feel really strong. Frenzy being the major source of damage can be paired with your choice of reload or draw time bonuses or the AoE of dragonfly. No choice is wrong from these options."

You can go a couple different routes with magazine and masterwork, but I prefer mag dumping and better burst dps with accelerated coils and charge time MW.

If I had some good Rambo moments where I could shred hordes of low-tier adds without having to recoil control that much I would love it. But having the lowest base stats across the machine gun archetypes and the fastest rpm makes them unwieldy. Arrowhead brake will bring up the terribly low recoil direction and having more in the magazine means you can be off target for 0.001s and not waste half your ammo. Feeding frenzy and field prep are both ways to bump up the decent reload speed. Golden tricorn will get you the best bang for your glimmer when paired with a void subclass.

// Disparity
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Disparity is probably the best weapon to come out of the season. A craftable aggressive burst pulse rifle that looks good, feels good, has a fantastic sight [...]. There are so many great perks to go for but the base will all be the same. Arrowhead to have near-perfect recoil direction. Flared magwell or tactical mag for a bump in reload / stability with the latter having a slight bump in magazine. Rapid hit is my preferred third column option but outlaw is easier and immediate. No need to build up stacks, just headshot and done. Frenzy is the immediate choice for a “no thoughts, head empty” workhorse weapon. Headstone and desperado are both fantastic for their respective builds. The former gives you slow, cover, and stasis synergy, while the latter gives you that Rambo effect turning your pulse into a mini machine gun." Recommended MW - Stability.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

Kill clip is the easiest to use and helps make the second kill easier as you won’t need as many critical hits. Headseeker is my pick for overall neutral play.

It can roll the infamous roll of dragonfly and explosive head, with the newly buffed dragonfly it should feel really strong. Frenzy being the major source of damage can be paired with your choice of reload or draw time bonuses or the AoE of dragonfly. No choice is wrong from these options."

//notes:pandapaxxy (PvP / M+KB / Controller): "In PvP lightweight bows are not the strongest choice. You can definitely make them work in either a swap build or by team-shooting with them.

[...] Fire and Forget also being stasis allows you to go big damage with Silence and Squall and font of might. The aggressive burst linear fusions are definitely best in slot.

You can go a couple different routes with magazine and masterwork, but I prefer mag dumping and better burst dps with accelerated coils and charge time MW. Field prep is best for pure damage, but headstone and vorpal are probably what I will be going for. That way I can have some decent damage and crowd control.

If I had some good Rambo moments where I could shred hordes of low-tier adds without having to recoil control that much I would love it. But having the lowest base stats across the machine gun archetypes and the fastest rpm makes them unwieldy. Arrowhead brake will bring up the terribly low recoil direction and having more in the magazine means you can be off target for 0.001s and not waste half your ammo. Feeding frenzy and field prep are both ways to bump up the decent reload speed. Golden tricorn will get you the best bang for your glimmer when paired with a void subclass.

Despite not having perfect recoil I would still try and hit 100 with arrowhead brake. Flared magwell or appended is dealer’s choice. I find with reload gauntlets or the plethora of ways to bypass reload are more than enough for me. Subsistence is one such way. Being able to ignore a whole stat on your weapon means you can invest those stat points into any other stat. You will still need to reload eventually and having a good reload stat will make that feel less like a slow molasses river. Finally there’s your damage perks. Frenzy is tried and true, and headstone is just a wonderful add clear perk. Multikill clip is best used with a dedicated reload perk like feeding frenzy or outlaw."

Having 14 zoom makes it firmly middle of the pack and having the lowest base range in its class (technically Escape Velocity is lower, but Escape Velocity also gets sights, not barrels) doesn’t help it. What it lacks in range it does make up for in stability, being on the upper percentile. It also has some of the best aim assist for its archetype.

The unique archetype will feel right at home with crucible affectionados and the grips can make up for some extra stats. Rose will excel if you bump up handling, stability and, most importantly, range. I would still not sacrifice other stats to make up for range, but if you happen to get more range I would take it."

// Veles-X
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Veles-X is an aggressive burst pulse rifle that doesn’t need a raid to acquire. [...] If you happen to use void, however, getting golden tricorn 2x should be a cakewalk. The synergy is there to take this gun with echo of instability. Get a kill with Veles-X first, throw a grenade and get volatile rounds. You have golden tricorn 2x, this can stack with font of might for insane damage output. You have volatile rounds for add clear and if you get the kill you’ll have a small overshield to use. This is incredible for almost all activities. Unless you can’t get the grenade kill easily I would keep this in your inventory." Recommended MW - Stability.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Veles-X
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvP / M+KB / Controller): "Veles-X will still have some incredible usefulness in PvP as well. Tunnel vision and kill clip are perfect with one another. At base you have an incredible pulse that can two burst. With kill clip it makes that two burst more forgiving but you also have tunnel vision for more aim assist. With the recent change to kill clip and tunnel vision, both can be refreshed so it keeps both perks active whenever you get a kill." Recommended MW - Stability.|tags:pvp,mkb,controller

// Albruna-D
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "For any PvE activity I will always try and prioritize recoil direction. Especially on special weapons or your main DPS weapon to make follow up shots easier. Any mag boosting perk will make the overall roll better. The usual suspects of triple tap, clown cartridge and field prep all make their appearance. Alongside our usual damage perks; firing line, frenzy and vorpal weapon. All of these damage perks are phenomenal, but use case specific. Firing line only works when in a full fireteam or raid, and you’d have to be within range for it to work. Frenzy only really works as long as you’re continuously taking damage or dealing it. Vorpal is the easiest to work with but also has the lowest damage output of all three."

// Prolonged Engagement
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "This submachine gun is incredible. Decent base stats, good base recoil direction, a million and a half perks. What could be better? Despite not having perfect recoil I would still try and hit 100 with arrowhead brake. Flared magwell or appended is dealer’s choice. I find with reload gauntlets or the plethora of ways to bypass reload are more than enough for me. Subsistence is one such way. Being able to ignore a whole stat on your weapon means you can invest those stat points into any other stat. You will still need to reload eventually and having a good reload stat will make that feel less like a slow molasses river. Finally there’s your damage perks. Frenzy is tried and true, and headstone is just a wonderful add clear perk. Multikill clip is best used with a dedicated reload perk like feeding frenzy or outlaw."

// Prolonged Engagement
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvP / Controller): "Unfortunately for Prolonged Engagement it won’t see a lot of use outside of PvE. Having 14 zoom makes it firmly middle of the pack and having the lowest base range in its class (technically Escape Velocity is lower, but Escape Velocity also gets sights, not barrels) doesn’t help it. What it lacks in range it does make up for in stability, being on the upper percentile. It also has some of the best aim assist for its archetype. Rangefinder is definitely a must, as is pushing up the range. Hammer-forged rifling or smallbore is going to be key, but don’t decrease other stats just to increase your range."

Impulse amplifier makes it more of a pocket rocket launcher, and rangefinder will just make whatever arc the grenade has minimal. Another good shout is explosive light. If you hold onto your explosive light shots, or build it up without having power ammo, you will have even more flexibility with the added damage, and be able to counter supers with ease."

Putting it in a range class well above its stats. It can also roll Iron Grip for a whopping +20 stability without sacrificing your barrel and magazine perks to stability. The only other auto rifle in this class to compete with Dark Decider would be Krait and given comparable rolls (DD - hammer-forged, accurized, iron grip, rangefinder / K - hammer-forged, ricochet, overflow, moving target) Dark Decider would have 2 whole meters over Krait.

With a recoil direction of 70 you really want to bump this up to max. Arrowhead brake is the first suggestion I have. With auto-loading holster you won’t have to worry about reload speed and you’ll get all the benefits of a bigger magazine with appended mag. Finally there’s target lock. This season’s newest perk. Target lock will increase your damage the longer you stay on target. With backup mag and appended mag you cap out your magazine at 75.

Being able to have such a huge refreshable buff that stacks with things like elemental wells, high-energy fire, and radiance is too good to pass up. Stasis isn’t the strongest on its own for abilities, but it might get a buff. Who knows." Recommended MW - Reload.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Stay Frosty
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvP / Controller): "Over in the crucible 450 pulses just aren’t anything important. Messenger exists, and the new hotness is Disparity. Stay Frosty has a lot to build up in order to compete. Arrowhead brake is a must, but smallbore is a decent alternative if you’re fine with the lower recoil direction. Ricochet rounds brings up the stability and bumps up the range a smidge. [...]  On Controller I would recommend something slightly different. Moving target is the only perk I would change. Moving target gives you aim assist and movement speed neutrally. That extra aim assist will help a ton to ensure a crit kill in order to get desperado going in the first place."

// Glacioclasm
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Subsistence will continue to keep reservoir burst up, but newer fusions can roll reservoir burst and keep it for more than one shot. Glacioclasm is a product of power creep, but that’s okay. Not needing to think about how many shots of reservoir burst you have left and instead going 1:1 makes things easier. Easy is good. I will also give a special shoutout to Golden tricorn. SImilar to Stay Frosty, having the ability cycling and one of the highest damage outputs you can imagine for this weapon type is incredible. Void also gives you more ways of uptime and refresh-ability. Definitely keep an eye out for that." Recommended MW - Handling.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Glacioclasm
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvP / M+KB / Controller): "In PvP it’s all about stacking as many consistency perks as possible. Lowering the charge time via accelerated coils and charge time MW so you won’t have to pre-charge as long. Arrowhead to make tracking easier. Under pressure for the most accuracy bonuses. High-impact reserves for some damage bonuses. It’s not going to be as quick as Midha’s Reckoning but it can get close and feel just as strong." Recommended MW - Charge Time.|tags:pvp,mkb,controller

// Avalanche
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "I am always both happy and sad when this weapon rolls around. Avalanche is just a relic of year 3. It’s a weird SUROS machine gun that fires from both barrels. The saving grace is being a 450 RPM machine gun. I went slightly different with my recommendations compared to my peers. With a recoil direction of 70 you really want to bump this up to max. Arrowhead brake is the first suggestion I have. With auto-loading holster you won’t have to worry about reload speed and you’ll get all the benefits of a bigger magazine with appended mag. Finally there’s target lock. This season’s newest perk. Target lock will increase your damage the longer you stay on target. With backup mag and appended mag you cap out your magazine at 75. With these many bullets you should definitely be the coolest person in your fireteam when you hit the cap on damage and be able to show off that sweet, sweet DEEPS." Recommended MW - Stability.|tags:pve,mkb,controller
dimwishlist:item=495940989&perks=3300816228


// Avalanche
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvP / Controller): "Adaptive machine guns have always been my favorite for PvP. Being able to have decent damage at range, good chip damage, and a pretty manageable recoil are all great things to have. Avalanche does bring some good things to the table, like maxing out recoil direction with arrowhead brake. Ricochet rounds gives you some much needed stability. Dynamic sway reduction will reduce your bloom on extended gunfights. [...] On Controller I would recommend tap the trigger for even more stability. Not all of it is needed, but having a gun you don’t have to fight will make your job easier and you can focus on your opponent." Recommended MW - Range.|tags:pvp,controller

title:WarlockMaggie's Season 19, Dawning Breakdown
description:Originally found at https://www.reddit.com/r/sharditkeepit/comments/zl9s10/rngeez_dawning_breakdown/

// Cold Front
//notes:WarlockMaggie (PvE / M+KB / Controller): Abysmal stability means this thing will kick like a mule and being under the 20 stability threshold means you’ll be taking extra flinch. So the priority with this weapon is to improve stability (and any other stats) as soon as possible. Enter the community-named “musketeer” build (Stats and One for All). With a quick pass over 3 targets, you’ll gain stats boosts and damage. Tac Mag may not be the most stat heavy option, but the extra bullet may help in securing that initial activation. Other stat raising perks can work, but don’t keep any rolls without ‘em. Remember, if you are a naughty Guardian, Xur will leave a Slickdraw / Gutshot Straight Cold Front in your stocking. |tags:pve,mkb,controller
dimwishlist:item=2814093983&perks=1583705720,4049631843


// Cold Front
//notes:WarlockMaggie (PvP / M+KB / Controller): Similar to my PvP recommendation, stability needs to be your priority but you can mix in range to get a bit more accuracy. Steady Rounds plus a Range MW provides that mix with a little extra Airborne Effectiveness to help you get the jump on your opponents. Combine that with a tried and true consistency combo of Tap the Trigger and Rangefinder, this will work for you if you put in the work of finding this roll. Recommended MW: Range|tags:pvp,mkb,controller
dimwishlist:item=2814093983&perks=1890422124,2846385770


// Stay Frosty
//notes:WarlockMaggie (PvE / M+KB / Controller): Stay Frosty is a Lightweight Pulse Rifle and I couldn’t be happier to have it in the game. Being a Stasis weapon, it has access to Headstone. Which not only is a hilarious perk when clearing mobs but also can help activate various Stasis Fragments that care about proximity or shattering of crystals. Well-Rounded is one of my favorite perks introduced this year, granting a stack of 10 range, stability and handling for using your grenade or scoring a hit with a charged melee. The gameplay loop is super satisfying and encourages integration of gunplay and ability usage. Recommended MW: Reload|tags:pve,mkb,controller
dimwishlist:item=2812100428&perks=744594675,124408337


// Stay Frosty
//notes:WarlockMaggie (PvP / M+KB / Controller): Encore got a rework this season and it works well with Desperado as any missed precision final blows will still increase the range, stability and accuracy of the weapon (5, 8, and 1.25% / stack, up to 4 stacks). With the classic combo of Arrowhead Brake and Ricochet Rounds, Stay Frosty will perform. Another possible fourth column perk would be Headseeker as it also got a rework that increases damage and aim assist. Either way, the lightweight frame will additionally give you a little boost in movement speed which may help you take cover from that Chaos Reach that just showed up. Recommended MW: Range|tags:pvp,mkb,controller

// Glacioclasm
//notes:WarlockMaggie (PvE / M+KB / Controller): Nothing beats the holiday whimsy of disintegrating your enemies in a void-powered explosion, getting a round auto-loaded, and then doing it all over again :) Glacioclasm hits hard, but it also handles like a brick. Look to your magazine perks for extra stability and reload, and try to aim for more stability and handling in your barrel. A Reload MW and the Omolon intrinsic trait will help make the rare time you need to reload not take an ice age. Recommended MW: Reload|tags:pve,mkb,controller
dimwishlist:item=3573686365&perks=1820235745,1427256713


// Glacioclasm
//notes:WarlockMaggie (PvP / M+KB / Controller): I’m not going to dissuade anyone from taking this into the Crucible, but bear in mind that pre-charging your shot is crucial to success with this archetype. Due to your starting ammo count of 2, Under Pressure and HIR will be already online, giving you a little extra stats and punch to dissolve that charging Guardian holding a Wastelander… Recommended MW: Charge Time|tags:pvp,mkb,controller
dimwishlist:item=3573686365&perks=1645158859,2213355989


// Avalanche
//notes:WarlockMaggie (PvE / M+KB / Controller): LMGs are without question some of the best mob-clearing weapons in the game. So lean into that with Subsistence and Incandescent. Avalanche takes Arrowhead quite nicely (70 to 100 recoil direction) and Ricochet rounds are my personal go-to for the range and stability bonuses it provides. Give it a try and you’ll see why it is my personal favorite LMG. Recommended MW: Reload|tags:pve,mkb,controller
dimwishlist:item=495940989&perks=1820235745,4293542123


// Avalanche
//notes:WarlockMaggie (PvP / M+KB / Controller): Adaptives are my favorite LMG archetype and this extends to use within Crucible. With a requirement of 5 crits to achieve the coveted .53s TTK, accuracy is going to be vital: enter DSR + Tap the Trigger. With DSR taking 0.6 seconds to fully ramp up, you will likely be near maximum benefit by that 5th shot. Like Hammerhead and other 450 rpm LMGs after it, this can catch many a Guardian by surprise and melt them quickly! Recommended MW: Range|tags:pvp,mkb,controller
dimwishlist:item=495940989&perks=1359896290,1890422124


// Zephyr
//notes:WarlockMaggie (PvE / M+KB / Controller): Cold Steel is what sets this blade apert from every other, the slow-into-freeze ability is an amazing pairing with Stasis subclasses as well as good utility for mods and effects that care about Stasis/Slow application. Couple it with Duelist’s Trance for extra stats. It’s a chilling prospect to consider… Recommended MW: Impact|tags:pve,mkb,controller
dimwishlist:item=396910433&perks=3705817207,3650930298


// Zephyr
//notes:WarlockMaggie (PvP / M+KB / Controller): Okay, hear me out on this combo. It’s a unique one to the Adaptive frame sword archetype and what it allows is the ability to steal the overshield of a supering Guardian and apply it to yourself while dealing increased damage. This could mean you can easily shut down roaming, ground-based supers and survive the opposing team’s retribution. Otherwise, it’s just like any other sword in the Crucible (that doesn’t have Eager Edge). Recommended MW: Impact|tags:pvp,mkb,controller

description:Originally found at https://www.reddit.com/r/sharditkeepit/comments/zl9s10/rngeez_dawning_breakdown/

// Cold Front
//notes:/u/SirStallion_ (PvE / M+KB / Controller): Smallbore and Flared are both going to provide minor buffs to stability which will be felt massively on a gun with a base of 7. Plus a little extra reload to help Frenzy along is never a bad thing, so Flared is a no brainer for me. Frenzy is fairly obvious, damage boost + reload boost baked into the same perk is really nice. Unrelenting may not be everyone's first pick, but for me, this gun feels like a mobbing monster, getting healing inside that same role is just a cherry on top. MW Unimportant|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Cold Front
//notes:/u/SirStallion_ (PvP / M+KB / Controller): While the main traits are obvious picks as far as this weapon is concerned, the rest is a little confusing. With a base 7 stability, will full sending into the stat actually make a meaningful difference? Will losing it entirely via Full Bore make a difference? I honestly don't know. I will be looking for these rolls because they're a great middle ground with a little extra stability for controllers. I do believe the rolls are interchangeable though, since it's just a MW difference. Recommended MW: Range (M+KB), Stability (Controller)|tags:pvp,mkb,controller
dimwishlist:item=2814093983&perks=1890422124,2846385770


// Stay Frosty
//notes:/u/SirStallion_ (PvE / M+KB / Controller): Let me address the elephant in the gun, "Thresh". Thresh is not often seen as a top tier perk, but that's because it's typically fighting for 4th slot against damage perks or better utility perks. In this case however, it's a 3rd slot pick which means you can use it in tandem with the better utility perk, "Headstone". Assuming the headstone explosions trigger Thresh in much the same way it does Stats for All and Unrelenting, it should make for some decent super gains for your stasis builds. Recommended MW: Stability|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Stay Frosty
//notes:/u/SirStallion_ (PvP / M+KB / Controller): Lightweight pulses are feeling a lot better in PvP these days and for me, Killing Wind and Kill Clip are perks that perfectly compliment each other and provide so many benefits to the gun it becomes a no brainer. With 55 Recoil Direction, Arrowhead Brake is a must on Stay Frosty and High-Caliber should assist in opening duels to get KW/KC rolling. Omolon Fluid Dynamics will make up for any stability or reload speed losses meaning you can get the extra little bit of range from the MW. Recommended MW: Range|tags:pvp,mkb,controller

// Glacioclasm
//notes:/u/SirStallion_ (PvE / M+KB / Controller): This roll feels fairly obvious. Kill stuff, Res Burst explodes them, Subsistence fills your mag and Res Burst is ready again. It's just good fun times and I didnt get it last year. The bonus damage from Res Burst will make up for the loss of impact from the Accelerated Coils and Charge Time MW.

// Glacioclasm
//notes:/u/SirStallion_ (PvP / M+KB / Controller): This weapon is a High-Impact. You can try to skirt that fact with lower charge times, but it will still charge slow and hit hard as long as you're accurate. I say embrace it and full send into consistency. Corrected recoil direction, higher stability, better accuracy while under fire. Which you inevitably will be with a High-Impact. Unlike PvE, I don't feel the attempt at lowering charge time is worth it. Recommended MW: Stability|tags:pvp,mkb,controller
dimwishlist:item=3573686365&perks=1645158859,699525795


// Avalanche
//notes:/u/SirStallion_ (PvE / M+KB / Controller): When my team calls for DPS, my choice is seldom the LMG. So for me, I'm shooting for mass mobbing potential and rocking this weapon with a double special setup. Similar thought process to Glacioclasm, kill stuff with big explosions (or in this case, Scorch) and refill the mag automatically. All reserves, no reload, but Flared Magwell just in case you get hit with a heaping spoonful of "Destiny" and things don't go to plan. Plus, the extra stability is nice. Recommended MW: Stability|tags:pve,mkb,controller
dimwishlist:item=495940989&perks=1820235745,4293542123


// Avalanche
//notes:/u/SirStallion_ (PvP / M+KB): As a 450, Avalanche falls into a very controllable category in PvP which means you can fairly comfortably commit to more range for short bursts of damage (like the time it might take to drop a guardian) instead of long term consistent shots. So, range range range. A little extra stability for the controller players and once you get a kill and trigger Encore, all subsequent kills should be a lot easier to manage. DSR is also an option, but only if going for multi-kills, in my opinion. If the kills are a little more spread out, I'd rather have Encore. Recommended MW: Range|tags:pvp,mkb

I personally would never take this sword into PvP, but if I absolutely had to I'd likely end up using my heavy to fight supers, which would never result in me escaping unscathed so unrelenting might help?

//notes: [YeezyGT's S18] [MW: Reload] "Planck's Stride is a unique LMG. Typically, I aim for strong stability, and ways to force a reload to make LMGs viable, as no one wants to spend 5 full seconds reloading mid-combat. Planck's doesn't really have that outside of Grave Robber, which means using an LMG for CQC engagements to get the most out of its perk pool. I can see it working with ranged melees, like with Warlock's Celestial Fire - a synergistic Karnstein, Grave Robber / Pugilist build could be fun. Ultimately, there's a few interesting options here for build-crafters, but not a lot to help it win out against better LMGs." tags:pve|tags:pve

// Yesteryear - [YeezyGT's S18] (pve)
//notes: [YeezyGT's S18] [MW: Handling] "Yesteryear is a gun with a dozen great options... on paper. You'll know which people have actually used the gun by the recommendations / rolls they're chasing. The base recoil direction and stability combo is bad. It kicks, 50RD is inconsistent at best, and sabotaging your play at worst. But -- if you get Heating Up, it completely fixes this, and allows you to make use of the utterly fantastic fourth column perks without reprieve. Heating Up / Golden Tricorn is my number 1, followed by Slideways, then more traditional options like Outlaw / Rampage, etc. If you're not running Heating Up, then definitely go for Arrowhead Brake and even consider running Counterbalance Stock here. Consistency is king." tags:pve|tags:pve

The 180RPM frame is familiar and well-loved, its stat package is great, and its got unconventional perk combos. It's probably better than my beloved Vouchsafe.

The Blunderbuss styling on a pocket-sized sidearm, the perk package including Threat Detector or Hip-Fire Grip, Enhanced Surrounded Spec going up to a 47% damage buff, then Voltshot which is simply phenomenal on this weapon type. Always invest MASSIVELY into Stability on Sidearms - Range quite simply does not matter for damage falloff. Is it Forbearance, or Trinity Ghoul? No. But hopefully, if we move back to a world where Primary weapons matter again, this is definitely in my backpack and ready for action." tags:pve|tags:pve

// Qullim's Terminus - [YeezyGT's S18]  (pve)
//notes: [YeezyGT's S18] [MW: Reload] "Qullim's Terminus wins the arms race on style points alone. Where it struggles is a slow Reload with little in the perk pool that can effectively mitigate this. Firefly and Ensemble can do some heavy lifting here - and Stats for All is beneficial for Reload once again, though even 100 Reload on an LMG pails in comparison to options like Demolitionist, Reconstruction, Auto-Loading Holster that don't ruin the flow of combat. My recommendation for Qullim's as a result is unfortunately tied to builds that have the ability to force a reload, using this LMG as a "glass cannon" style, investing into Heating Up / Killing Tally to benefit from recoil and stability boosts, and completely clear a room before needing to initiate a reload. Firefly and Headstone are neat, though you'll find yourself activating them far less frequently than you'd think - LMGs don't shine in their precision capabilities." tags:pve|tags:pve

// Blood Feud - [YeezyGT's S18]  (pve)
//notes: [YeezyGT's S18] [MW: Reload] "Blood Feud is slowly replacing my favourite SMG, Extraordinary Rendition. The new Ambitious Assassin buff is extremely good on this archetype, coupled with S-Tier SMG perk Frenzy. You can get comparable to Threat Detector speeds with a near-constant 15% damage buff, and going beyond double your mag size just by snowballing kills. When you set this thing up the right way, it plays fantastically well. Truly its only downside, from personal preference, comes from poor shading - for me, it doesn't win out on style points. So, is it function over form? Up to you." tags:pve|tags:pve

// Doom of Chelchis - [YeezyGT's S18] (god-pve)
//notes: [YeezyGT's S18] [MW: Handling] "Doom of Chelchis (chell-chiss or kell-kiss?) is the does-it-all Scout Rifle. Explo/Frenzy. Adaptive Munitions. Firefly/Dragonfly. It shoots bad guys. It does your taxes. It looks phenomenal. Adaptive Munitions is incredibly strong for Match Game, and with how often Anti-Barrier Scout pops up, it's very valuable here. The 180RPM frame is familiar and well-loved, its stat package is great, and its got unconventional perk combos. It's probably better than my beloved Vouchsafe. I won't definitively admit it, but the sentiment is out there. Fantastic weapon." tags:god-pve|tags:god-pve

It's one of the privileged few to have Demolitionist in the third column, meaning you have access to Demo/Swashbuckler (for synergy with the Right Hook origin trait), Demo/Voltshot if you want the long-range jolting capability, and also Dragonfly which I'll never not recommend based on fun factor alone.

Deliverance has great synergy with grenade-based Stasis builds, but Riptide is class-agnostic, sporting Auto-Loading Holster, easy-to-get, and can fire four (4!) Chill Clip rounds using the default mag size. That's two separate freezes on a Rapid-Fire frame. You can shoot a rocket, swap to Riptide, and freeze a Barrier Champion in a Grandmaster before it even pulls up its shield.

// Qullim's Terminus (Harrowed) - [YeezyGT's S18]  (pve)
//notes: [YeezyGT's S18] [MW: Reload] "Qullim's Terminus wins the arms race on style points alone. Where it struggles is a slow Reload with little in the perk pool that can effectively mitigate this. Firefly and Ensemble can do some heavy lifting here - and Stats for All is beneficial for Reload once again, though even 100 Reload on an LMG pails in comparison to options like Demolitionist, Reconstruction, Auto-Loading Holster that don't ruin the flow of combat. My recommendation for Qullim's as a result is unfortunately tied to builds that have the ability to force a reload, using this LMG as a "glass cannon" style, investing into Heating Up / Killing Tally to benefit from recoil and stability boosts, and completely clear a room before needing to initiate a reload. Firefly and Headstone are neat, though you'll find yourself activating them far less frequently than you'd think - LMGs don't shine in their precision capabilities." tags:pve|tags:pve

For PvE, you're looking for consistent damage uptime, high Handling (always important for Champion content), and ways to bolster your abilities. Smite does all of this quite well. I'd be looking at Demo/Gutshot for high-level (Vorpal if Anti-Barrier Pulse is a thing), Demo/Adrenaline for low-level content, and Firefly just for the fun factor.

// (Polygonal Rifling, Chambered Compensator, Smallbore, Fluted Barrel, Corkscrew Rifling, Hammer-Forged Rifling), Ricochet Rounds, Dynamic Sway Reduction, Tap the Trigger
//notes:Inspired by DMB Podcast 280 with @ImpetusAlways. First-choice PvP pick for duelling. The Origin Trait is aimed more at 3v3 game modes, where you're less likely to be near a team mate to gain the better ADS and strafe speed. A competitive subfamily TTK of 0.8s if you can hit 6 crits and 1 body shot, and a not-awful accuracy-adjusted TTK of 0.93s (4c, 4b) as at v6.2.5. Decent stats within the subfamily. Ignore the recoil direction, as this is a precision frame, so you can use the barrel to fill in your favoured stat - this does have the lowest zoom of its peers so you can either try and compensate with range, or live with it and improve stability. Ricochet Rounds adds range and stability, and is your best mag choice. For duelling, you don't really need to look further than Dynamic Sway Reduction and Tap the Trigger which together add stability and accuracy through your volley. Recommended MW: Stability or Range, with a Quick Access Sling, Sprint Grip or Targeting Adjuster mod depending on your preference.|tags: PvP, PvP-Duel, PvP-God, MKB, Controller

//notes:Inspired by DMB Podcast 280 with @ImpetusAlways. Backup PvP pick for duelling. The Origin Trait is aimed more at 3v3 game modes, where you're less likely to be near a team mate to gain the better ADS and strafe speed. A competitive subfamily TTK of 0.8s if you can hit 6 crits and 1 body shot, and a not-awful accuracy-adjusted TTK of 0.93s (4c, 4b) as at v6.2.5. Decent stats within the subfamily. Ignore the recoil direction, as this is a precision frame, so you can use the barrel and mag perks to fill in your favoured stats - this does have the lowest zoom of its peers so you can either try and compensate with range, or live with it and improve stability. For duelling, Dynamic Sway Reduction is always great although, if you have the discipline to use the bottom half of a magazine, rather than continually reloading, Under Pressure offers great stability and accuracy boosts too. Finally, in the second trait column, Tap the Trigger which adds stability and accuracy when you need it, on initial trigger pull. Recommended MW: Stability or Range, with a Quick Access Sling, Sprint Grip or Targeting Adjuster mod depending on your preference.|tags: PvP, PvP-Duel, MKB, Controller

//notes:Inspired by DMB Podcast 280 with @ImpetusAlways. First-choice PvP pick for kill-chaining, particularly for solar subclasses. The Origin Trait is aimed more at 3v3 game modes, where you're less likely to be near a team mate to gain the better ADS and strafe speed. Reasonably competitive out of the box with a subfamily TTK of 0.8s with 8 crits and 1 body shot), and an accuracy-adjusted TTK of 1.00s (7c, 3b) which only needs the smallest of damage boosts to improve as at v6.2.5. Unfortunately, stats are pretty weak across the board - the 50 Recoil Direction and joint lowest zoom means that, even with a recoil direction-correcting or stability barrel, you'll will still probably find a Counterbalance mod necessary. You really need both more range and more stability, once you've sorted the recoil direction, so Ricochet Rounds are your best mag perk. In the first trait column, Rangefinder will help push out range with an extra point of zoom. The second trait column is a bit short on PvP picks, but Golden Tricorn is the most reliable damage perk. One stack after a kill drops TTK down to 0.73s (7c, 1b) and accuracy-adjusted TTK to 0.8s (5c, 4b). If you manage to proc both stacks, this drops further to a lightning-fast TTK of 0.47s (6c) or an accuracy-adjusted TTK of 0.67s (4c, 3b). Recommended MW: Stability, with a Counterbalance mod.|tags: PvP, PvP-KillChain, PvP-God, MKB, Controller

// (Barrel Shroud, Full Choke, Smallbore, Corkscrew Rifling), Assault Mag, Slideshot, Opening Shot
//notes:Inspired by DMB Podcast 279 with @Saint_Kabr. First-choice PvP pick for duelling. Shapeable. The Hot Swap origin trait works well for PvP, boosting handling when swapping to the weapon while damaged for quick swaps and ADS speed. The Lightweight frame suits aggressive, mobile playstyles, boosting sprint speed by 6.25% and passively adding 20 mobility to help close gaps quickly - you'll need to hit 11 out of 12 pellets for a kill at any resilience. Good all-round stats within the subfamily. For Lightweights, range needs to be over 80 to give a 6.28m range - aim to get to 55 with your barrel, mag and masterwork, without hurting handling or projectile spread. Then Slideshot will add 20, and Opening Shot another 25 to get to 100, which pushes the range out to 7m. Just remember to ABS (always be sliding), and always follow up with a melee!

// 1000 Yard Stare (PvP first-choice roll)
// Fluted Barrel, Flared Magwell, Quickdraw, Snapshot Sights
//notes:Inspired by DMB Podcast 279 with @Saint_Kabr. First-choice PvP pick for duelling.

// Retraced Path (PvP first-choice roll)
// Smallbore, Tactical Battery, (Well-Rounded, Perpetual Motion), Golden Tricorn
//notes:Inspired by DMB Podcast 279 with @Saint_Kabr. First-choice PvP pick for kill-chaining, particularly with a solar subclass. Shapeable. The Hot Swap origin trait works well for PvP, boosting handling when swapping to the weapon while damaged for quick swaps and ADS speed. Great stats - standard for trace rifles, but not quite as good as Hollow Denial. Difficult to work out what role it plays in the sandbox, effectively being a very accurate high ROF auto rifle that uses special ammo. The base accuracy-adjusted TTK is 0.8s wth 8 crits and 5 body shots, but small damage buffs do make it easier to use - Golden Tricorn x1 or Radiant get you to 0.73s TTK in 5 crits and 7 bodies, and if you can get Golden Tricorn x2 up (and have enough battery charge left), you can get an Accuracy-Adjusted TTK of 0.53s with 5 crits and 4 bodies. Choose a barrel that doesn't have any penalties and Tactical Battery provides a range of small gunfeel stat boosts. In the first trait column, Well-Rounded or Perpetual Motion both help further with gunfeel stats and, in the second, Golden Tricorn is the best damage boost for PvP. This could be very good with a Hunter Caliban's Hand build...

title:King's Fall Raid PvP weapon picks with illPhysics
description:Reprised King's Fall weapons with Runneth Over origin trait

// Doom of Chelchis (PvP first-choice roll)
// Fluted Barrel, Flared Magwell, Explosive Payload, Eye Of The Storm
//notes:Inspired by DMB Podcast 277 with @illPhysics. Shapeable.  First-choice PvP pick for duelling on larger maps. Not that great as a subfamily in PvP, in un-perked form, but very responsive to any damage buff - Radiant, Empowering Rift and High Energy Fire mean you can achieve a 3-crit kill in 0.67s against any resilience, as at v6.2.0.7. Doom has lower stability and zoom than comparators - this helps with your sight picture, but means the recoil isn't constrained quite as much. It should still be fairly easily controllable, so you can spec into Handling, and maybe a little bit of reload in your barrel and mag. For duelling, Explosive Payload (at 180 RPM) and Eye of the Storm has the potential to really irritate opponents at the same time as making crit shots easier to hit in a firefight. Recommended MW: Handling or Reload Speed, with a Radar Tuner (to help you stay aware of your surroundings if hardscoping), Quick Access Sling or Sprint Grip mod depending on your preference.|tags: PvP, PvP-Duel, PvP-God, MKB, Controller

//notes:Inspired by DMB Podcast 277 with @illPhysics. Shapeable. First-choice PvP pick for duelling. Average stats compared to its competition in-slt, apart from a higher Aerial Effectiveness stat, but very responsive to any damage buff - Radiant, Empowering Rift and High Energy Fire mean you can achieve an on-paper 2-burst, 6-crit kill in 0.6s against any resilience, as at v6.2.0.7. The lower zoom of 17 means you have a more open sight picture than other adaptive pulse rifles, but also means the recoil is less constrained too, so first choice in the barrel is Arrowhead Brake, which brings Recoil Direction to 100, and improves Handling.

// (Hammer-Forged Rifling, Extended Barrel, Full Bore), (Projection Fuse, Accelerated Coils), Backup Plan, Successful Warm-Up
//notes:Inspired by DMB Podcast 277 with @illPhysics (and thanks to @Legoleflash). First-choice PvP pick - one of those rare weapons that works for both duelling and kill-chaining. Shapeable. Definitely not meta out of the box as at v6.2.0.7 with a base TTK of 1.09s with four bolts, but there's a perk combination that helps with that. Most stats are okayish, with Aim Assistance a standout highest in class - add in some targeting mods on the weapon and helmet if you want to build into this weapon. You're only firing five bolts, so you can spec into range with your barrel, as controlling the recoil should be easier. With the battery perk, you might be tempted by Accelerated Coils for an even faster charge time, but you'll probably get more use from Projection Fuse's extra range for consistency. The real fun is in the two trait columns - Backup Plan gets you to 100 Handling on swapping, and brings the TTK for your first shot down to 0.81s. After your first kill, Successful Warm-Up kicks into reduce it still further to 0.73s. You still need to hit 4 out of 5 bolts, but the targeting mods make that much easier to achieve, and the TTK is faster than an out-of-the-box Rapid Fire Fusion Rifle.

// Mindbender's Ambition (PvE first-choice roll)
// (Barrel Shroud, Corkscrew Rifling, Smallbore), (Assault Mag, Tactical Mag), Puglist, Swashbuckler
//notes:Inspired by DMB PvE Podcast 34. PvE first-choice roll for burst damage against Majors and stunned Champions in end-game content. Probably only necessary if you've not already got a good solar shotgun that does the same job.

As with all playlist weapons, the more reputation resets you can get, the more trait options you'll get to play with, otherwise you've only got a 1/144 chance of any pair of traits dropping, before you even look at barrel, mag and masterwork. Out of the box TTK  of 1s with 2 crits and 1 body - the subfamily's low stability makes a third crit more difficult. Stats are average, so this won't replace a well-rolled Palindrome or Eyasluna. If you are duelling, then round out the stats with Fluted Barrel and Ricochet Rounds or Flared Magwell. Then, for duelling, Well-Rounded or Perpetual Motion fill out the stats nicely, and Eye of the Storm makes hitting your third shot in a gunfight easier.

Stats are on the low side, including a truly terrible Recoil Direction of 50, so you will need a Counterbalance mod even with Arrowhead Brake, but you'll also benefit from its reduction of 30 bounce intensity, so it's still the best barrel park.

You have access to an excellent PvP origin perk for SMGs in Omolon Fluid Dynamics, in a solid SMG subfamily, needing only the smallest of damage buffs to go from a TTK of 0.67s with 11 crits and 1 body, to a 0.6s 8 crit, 2 body kill. Stats are on the low side, and with a Zoom of only 14, you'll never compete with a range specced Multimach or Shayura's, so focus on making this as good a CQC SMG as you're likely to meet. Add as much Handling and Stability as you can with barrel and mag so you can keep the reticule on target for crits. For a kill-chaining roll, Heating Up or Killing Wind will help with follow-up kills. If you can keep the action in the top half of the magazine, the Omolon origin trait should help keep everything on target. One stack of any damage perk will then get you to the 0.6s TTK. Recommended MW: Stability or Handling, with a Targeting Adjustor, Quick Access Sling or Sprint Grip mod depending on your preference.|tags: PvP, PvP-Duel, MKB, Controller

@title:Season of Plunder PvP weapon picks with Gleaux
@description:Season 18 weapons with Right Hook origin perk

// Hung Jury SR4 (PvP first-choice roll)
// Fluted Barrel, Steady Roads, Rapid Hit, Box Breathing
//notes:First choice PvP roll for duelling. Inspired by DMB Podcast 275 conversation with @DefyFly. The main draw for Hung Jury as at v6.2.0.6 is Box Breathing in the second trait column, which means you can three tap any resilience (2 Crit + 1 Body of a 0.67s TTK) and two tap tap lower resiliences, as at Season 18 v6.2.0.6. To proc it though, you need to almost treat the weapon like it needs pre-charging by ADS-ing before an ancounter, It goes without saying, you need to land crits and stay mobile. You don't need extra range, so focus on Handling and Stability with your barrel and mag. Rapid Hit in the first trait column helps further with Stability (as well as a Reload Speed boost) Recommended MW: Handling, with a Full Auto Retrofit mod, Radar Tuner (to help you stay aware of your surroundings if hardscoping), Quick Access Sling or Sprint Grip mod depending on your preference.|tags: PvP, PvP-Duelling, PvP-God, MKB, Controller

Kill Clip, in the second trait column, reduces the TTK to a competitive 0.7s (3 crits, 1 body), as at Season 18 v6.2.0.6, and you can pair this with Tunnel Vision which procs on the same condition and makes your follow-up kills easier.

Sidearms aren't first choice for end-game activities but, if you're forced to use one there because of an anti-Champion mod, the you do have some options here. Range is highly constrained (maximising it only gets you another 0.7m when ADS), so you'll get more value out of Handling or Stability from your barrel, and any of the combat effect mods (Armor-Piercing, High Caliber or Riochet Rounds) will work. For end-game stuff, you'll have to get close up, so use that to your advantage with Threat Detector and then Surrounded provides a hefty 46% damage boots with the spec mod (once that's rolled in to the perk by Bungie, go for a damage-boosting mod or Backup Mag).

Range is highly constrained (maximising it only gets you another 0.7m when ADS), so you'll get more value out of Handling or Stability from your barrel.

// Allied Demand
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE Controller \ M+KB): Recommended MW: Reload “Allied Demand is a great weapon to see come back. I love the 300 rpm adaptive frame sidearms. Something about them just feels best. Not quite the bullet hoses of the 450s, a little less fatiguing on the finger than the 360s, and feel better than the 260s for me. In PvE I really would not take a sidearm into any serious activities. They just do not have the damage or the range you would want to make them feel as effective. To make this sidearm feel as good as possible I would recommend bumping up the handling and stability. Sure you will not be able to shoot as far, but you are using a sidearm. Be real here. Frenzy is great for getting that quick damage and reload. With such a small mag another great shout is multikill clip to keep damage stacks after each kill.“ (Year 5 S18: Season of Plunder Kinetic Sidearm Primary Ammo)|tags:PvE, Controller, M+KB

// Blood Feud
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE Controller \ M+KB): Recommended MW: Reload “Blood Feud looks to be the best weapon from Plunder activities. Being a stasis 750 with arguably better roll combinations over Cold Front from the Dawning. Wait just a second, Cold Front was not even Stasis. In PvE I think the absolute best combo is going to be ambitious assassin with headstone. Headstone kills do proc ambitious assassin for you to overload your magazine. It can be a little finicky but it does work. If you would prefer non-Stasis oriented builds and a more neutral weapon you can go for the most punchy weapon this side of Titan (RIP Sloane). Grave robber or pugilist with swashbuckler is the play. Just make sure to have some stability so you will not be looking at Io (RIP Asher).“ (Year 5 S18: Season of Plunder Stasis Submachine Gun Primary Ammo)|tags:PvE, Controller, M+KB

// Mindbender's Ambition
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvP Controller): Recommended MW: Handling “In PvP you can make arguments for and against the return of Mindbender's Ambition. On one hand it is still a strong aggressive frame shotgun that can get adept mods. On the other hand so is the Timelost Found Verdict and VoG is less of a challenge. Master VoG will still kick an unprepared ass, but will not be nearly as difficult as it used to be. To make Mindbender's Ambition work in the crucible you will have to invest into range and handling. Threat detector will take up a decent chunk of handling by speeding up the ready animation.

//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE Controller \ M+KB): Recommended MW: Reload “The newest crucible weapon is only the slightest bit a disappointment for me. it is an Omolon 900 without phase mag. If you were not around in d2y1 or missed getting a good Stochastic Variable in Season of the Splicer, phase mag is a special Omolon magazine that drops the rpm from 900 (lightweight) to 600 (precision), and increases the damage profile to match the precision frames. The smg keeps its other stats, and retains the lightweight profile, but just hits like a precision frame. Not having that on an Omolon smg just feels wrong. Especially when it is not going to be better than regular lightweights or precision frame smgs. I digress. In most activities you will either have on Funnelweb or CALUS-Mini Tool. Out of Bounds acts as an arc alternative. With how good some arc 3.0 ability cycling is, you can almost guarantee two stacks of golden tricorn. Paired with subsistence to really tear down hordes of enemies. Out of Bounds is not going to be the best, and getting one is going to take some time.

// Pure Poetry
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE Controller \ M+KB): Recommended MW: Reload “Pure Poetry is a fantastic addition to the 120 family. With both Crimil's Dagger and Steady Hand being removed from the Iron Banner loot pool there really is only Loud Lullaby in the kinetic slot. Pure Poetry is not the best option, but it is nice to have it. The best benefit over Loud Lullaby is when you get a few resets in for your vanguard rep and have multiple perks within each column. For PvE outlaw is going to be your best friend. It can allow you to completely ignore reload and invest into handling or stability for your preference. Another great option is the newly buffed ambitious assassin to also circumvent the low mag / low reload speed. In the fourth column you cannot go wrong with any number of damage perks. Frenzy, rampage, harmony, focused fury, multikill clip, or the new pugilist. Any and all of them are fantastic, but slightly player dependent.“ (Year 5 S18: Season of Plunder Kinetic Hand Cannon Primary Ammo)|tags:PvE, Controller, M+KB

//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE Controller \ M+KB): Recommended MW: Reload or Charge Time “Taipan-4fr is incredible for what it is. it is a craftable linear fusion rifle with perks that compare and get it close to things like Reed's Regret and Stormchaser. It lowers the barrier for entry and to be competitive if you do not play trials or dungeons. I love this for Bungie. More ways for players to get competitive loot out of the gate. Firing line, frenzy, or focused fury are all incredibly strong options. Rapid hit makes it easier to land consecutive crits, clown cartridge will overflow your magazine, and if you can remember to crouch field prep will be your best option for reserves and a fast reload.“ (Year 5 S18: Season of Plunder Void Linear Fusion Rifle Heavy Ammo)|tags:PvE, Controller, M+KB

//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE Controller \ M+KB): Recommended MW: Reload “I am so very glad Militia's Birthright is back. Mostly for my friend u/The_SpellJammer. Militia's Birthright has not really seen too many changes from its former self. Ambitious and auto-loading are funny together, but unfortunately do not proc one another. Lead from gold is another fantastic perk when paired with a full lead from gold build. Frenzy is the top choice for the final column. Having two grenades with the 15% damage increase, 50 handling, and the most important part being the 50 reload. The reload alone will max out your reload stat making it easier to reload into ambitious assassin.“ (Year 5 S18: Season of Plunder Kinetic Grenade Launcher Special Ammo)|tags:PvE, Controller, M+KB

// Yesteryear
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE Controller \ M+KB): Recommended MW: Reload “Yesteryear is a fun addition to the 390 archetype. I am slightly disappointed you need arrowhead brake to make this weapon feel good. Coupled with a counterbalance mod and you hit the sweet spot of 95. Outlaw makes a return as the best reload perk. Which is unfortunate seeing as rapid hit is objectively better. Subsistence is another great option but loses value in higher end content. Focused fury paired with rapid hit would be an incredible combo on a primary, if Yesteryear would have gotten that combo it would be the only pulse rifle in the game with those two perks at the same time. Ambitious assassin with multikill clip is an extremely fun combination of increasing the magazine as well as increasing your damage at the same time.“ (Year 5 S18: Season of Plunder Void Pulse Rifle Primary Ammo)|tags:PvE, Controller, M+KB

Want to use Izanagi's Burden or Arbalest? cannot use Fatebringer, the choice has been made for you.

// Zaouli's Bane (Harrowed)
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE Controller \ M+KB): Recommended MW: Reload “Did someone say energy Fatebringer? I think so. While it is great to cross compare weapons like that, all it does is allow for loadout diversity. Neither is “superior” because realistically you will not be making the choice of Fatebringer vs Zaouli's Bane, you will have your special weapon combination as well to consider. Want to use Izanagi's Burden or Arbalest? cannot use Fatebringer, the choice has been made for you. Firefly and explosive payload is the combo to get, but incandescent does not require that crit and can make more boom better.“ (Year 5 S18: Season of Plunder Solar Hand Cannon Primary Ammo)|tags:PvE, Controller, M+KB

title:Season of Plunder PvP weapon picks with Gleaux
description:Season 18 weapons with Right Hook origin perk

// Tarnished Mettle (PvP first-choice roll)
// (Arrowhead Brake, Polygonal Rifling, Chambered Compensator, Smallbore, Fluted Barrel, Corkscrew Rifling), Steady Rounds, Moving Target, (Eye of the Storm, Explosive Payload)
//notes:Inspired by DMB Podcast 275 conversation with Gleaux. Not a great TTK as at v6.2.0.6, and the Origin Perk is really aimed at CQC, so won't be much use. Shapeable. In-band stats except for the high Airborne Effectiveness (if you wanted to jump shoot with a Scout!). The lethality perks are difficult to proc to a level where they make any meaningful difference, so aim to shape yourself something close a legendary MIDA for duelling. You can either help sort out the wonky Recoil Direction with Arrowhead Brake, or look to add stability with your barrel. You don't really need to worry about range, so Steady Rounds gives you even more stability and increases AE to 25. A Targeting mod or two on your helmet and Enhanced Moving Target can get you close to 100 Aim Assistance. Finally Enhanced Eye of the Storm just makes landing crits in combat easier or Explosive Payload crits at 200RPM can seriously mess with an opponent's day.  Recommended MW: Stability or Handling, with a Sprint Grip, Quick Access Sling, Freehand Grip (or Icarus Grip if you're serious about aerial use) mod depending on your preference.|tags: PvP, PvP-God, PvP-Duel, Controller, MKB

// Blood Feud (PvP first-choice roll)
// Hammer-Forged Rifling, Accurized Rounds, Dynamic Sway Reducation, Elemental Capacitor
//notes:Inspired by DMB Podcast 275 conversation with Gleaux. The Origin Perk is really aimed at CQC, so should be useful here, and the accuracy-adjusted time to kill is competitive, but this is difficult to recommend over Ikelos or Borrowed Time which both have better base stats. Shapeable. If you are going to shape one for duelling, to tuck away just in case, you might as well add to range with barrel and mag, and then make it more controllable with Dynamic Sway Reduction and Elemental Capacitor with a Void subclass. Recommended MW: Stability or Range, with a Freehand Grip, Quick Access Sling, or Sprint Grip mod depending on your preference.|tags: PvP, PvP-God, PvP-Duel, Controller, MKB
dimwishlist:item=1509167284&perks=1359896290,3511092054

// Blood Feud (PvP first-choice roll)
// Polygonal Rifling, Steady Rounds, Pugilist, Swashbuckler
//notes:Inspired by DMB Podcast 275 conversation with Gleaux. The Origin Perk is really aimed at CQC, so should be useful here, and the accuracy-adjusted time to kill is competitive, but this is difficult to recommend over Ikelos or Borrowed Time which both have better base stats. Shapeable. If you are going to shape one for kill-chaining, to tuck away just in case, just lean into CQC and add as much stability as you can with barrel and mag and then take advantage of the synergy between Pugilist and Swashbuckler - this could work well on Stasis classes using abilities to freeze and then melee an opponent (also proccing the origin trait) to go on a tear with fully-procced Swashbuckler, and additionally building into Font of Might on your armour mods for even more damage. Recommended MW: Stability, with a Freehand Grip, Quick Access Sling, or Sprint Grip mod depending on your preference.|tags: PvP, PvP-God, PvP-Chain, Controller, MKB

// Brigand's Law (PvP first-choice roll)
// (Fluted Barrel, Corkscrew Rifling, Smallbore, Hammer-Forged Rifling), Accurized Rounds, (Hip-Fire Grip, Threat Detector, Perpetual Motion), (Swashbuckler, Surrounded)
//notes:Inspired by DMB Podcast 275 conversation with Gleaux. The Origin Perk is aimed at CQC, so should be useful here. Shapeable. Rapid-fire sidearms have competitive TTK as at v6.2.0.6, and the stats compare well in the slot but it's hard to look past Drang if you're thinking about energy sidearms. Range is really constrained in sidearms, so you could add an extra 0.75m or boost handling or stability with your barrel and mag. With the traits, lean into an aggressive playstyle and shape a kill-chaining weapon with Hip-Fire Grip to improve hip-fire performance, or Threat Detector or Perpetual Motion to add to your gunfeel stats in the first trait column, and your choice of Swashbuckler or Surrounded, both of which can reduce your TTK dramatically when fully procced in the second.

// (Full Bore, Hammer-Forged Rifling), Accurized Rounds, Pugilist, Headstone
//notes:Inspired by DMB Podcast 275 conversation with Gleaux. The Origin Perk is aimed at CQC, so should be useful here. Shapeable. Excellent first-choice slug-shottie, particularly for Stasis subclasses who can use an Aspect to create Stasis shards, and Fragments to use those to regain melee and grenade energy or for Damage Reduction. Go for range with your barrel and mag. Then, as this is a CQC weapon, Pugilist is the best option for the first trait column, and  Headstone gives you all the stasis good stuff in the second and, as a bonus in Comp or Trials, prevents revives while the crystal persists.

//notes:Inspired by DMB PvE Podcast 32. PvE first-choice roll for end-game content. Shapeable. The Origin Perk is aimed at playing with a fireteam - the larger, the better your magazine size after reload will be. Decent in-slot stats compared to Exile's Curse or Wizened Rebuke. Generally, with fewer bolts being fired from a High-Impact frame, you don't have to worry so much about stability, so can either push the range or improve handling with your barrel. Increasing the battery size with Ionised Battery and Reservoir Burst pushes you to the maximum of 8 in the mag (with Enhanced RB you only need Enhanced Battery). You can get around the reload penalty from Ionised Battery when crouching with Field Prep (and have more ammo in reserve) to use in combination with Reservoir Burst. With a battery size of eight, you'll get up to five overflowed shots with the origin trait if you're in a Raid near a full fireteam, or three reloading in a normal fireteam of three. RB procs on any overflowed charges from the origin trait, with a 25% damage bonus and those lovely explosions on kills (maybe with Arc 3.0 Spark of Beacons for a bit of blinding too) on them all.

Increasing the battery size with Ionised Battery and Reservoir Burst pushes you to the maximum of 8 in the mag. You should be getting plenty of kills with Reservoir Burst, so you can use Unrelenting to recover your health while in combat. With a battery size of eight, you'll get up to five overflowed shots with the origin trait if you're in a Raid near a full fireteam, or three reloading in a normal fireteam of three. RB procs on any overflowed charges from the origin trait, with a 25% damage bonus and those lovely explosions on kills (maybe with Arc 3.0 Spark of Beacons for a bit of blinding too) on them all.

// Lingering Dread
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Chill clip on a tube grenade launcher? Heck yeah. Sign me up. Now that blinding grenades and concussion grenades caught another nerf, any crowd control is good crowd control. Spike grenades will see a small rise in popularity with Lingering Dread as you do need direct impacts to apply the slow effect. Auto-loading holster or ambitious assassin are both incredible for two different play styles, but a sleeper perk is unrelenting. You can easily get multikills with grenade launchers, and the added health regeneration is noticeable" Recommended MW - Reload.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Lingering Dread
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvP / M+KB / Controller): "In PvP you could try for chill clip but I think the utility of demolitionist for potentially shooting twice in quick succession is better. You’ll also need to have good aim to get those direct hits. Whereas with demolitionist if you do happen to get a kill with Lingering Dread you’ll just get some of your grenade cooldown knocked off. Proximity grenades are the best in slot for demoltionist, but if you wanted the alternative high-velocity rounds for getting the grenade to targets with chill clip is the way to go."

// New Purpose
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "New Purpose fills a different niche compared to Messenger. Neither are stronger than the other. New Purpose has headstone, vorpal weapon, and feeding frenzy. Messenger has rapid hit and adept mods. I think the strength of New Purpose is its synergy with stasis as well as the addition of feeding frenzy and vorpal weapon. Both have the stopping power of buffed desperado, but having vorpal for majors and champs is a bonus in New Purpose’s corner." Recommended MW - Reload.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// New Purpose
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvP / M+KB / Controller): "In terms of PvP it’s really close. Rapid hit and the adept mods to give a small edge to messenger, but needing only arrowhead brake to clean up the recoil and have a perfectly vertical recoil direction is really hard to pass up. It completely frees up your mod slot for radar tuner, targeting, or whatever else tickles your fancy." Recommended MW - Range (M+KB) or Stability (Controller).|tags:pvp,mkb,controller

While it doesn’t have the best PvE applications it is still a great option" Recommended MW - Reload.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// The Epicurean
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvP / M+KB): "Rangefinder is the absolute best in slot perk for the Epicurean. Zoom is the most important thing on fusion rifles. While Main Ingredient still boasts the best in class zoom, the Epicurean can come pretty close. Snapshot sights or surplus will make the Epicurean feel lighter or handle better which is one of its lowest stats. Look for arrowhead brake to clean up the recoil and make those longer ranged voops easier to handle." Recommended MW - Stability.|tags:pvp,mkb

// The Epicurean
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvP / Controller): "Rangefinder is the absolute best in slot perk for the Epicurean. Zoom is the most important thing on fusion rifles. While Main Ingredient still boasts the best in class zoom, the Epicurean can come pretty close. Snapshot sights or surplus will make the Epicurean feel lighter or handle better which is one of its lowest stats. Look for arrowhead brake to clean up the recoil and make those longer ranged voops easier to handle." Recommended MW - Stability.|tags:pvp,controller

Any mag boosting perk is preferred in the second column. Feeding frenzy or field prep will depend on how you play, but both bring up another low stat. Finally depending on how you play, killing tally, firing line, or incandescent are all fantastic perks. If you’re using a Solar 3.0 subclass, incandescent and feeding frenzy make a great pairing.

// Chain of Command
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "The unique factor is Osmosis to change its damage type from stasis to whatever subclass you happen to be on. A real jack of all trades. Unfortunately it is the true master of one. Having both adrenaline junkie and demolitionist really elevate it with grenade builds on Void 3.0 or some Solar 3.0 builds, but I would rather have either a dedicated “big-deeps” machine gun or an add clear machine gun with firefly or dragonfly. I don’t really find myself using machine guns for add clearing, but having a very reliable weapon for grenade builds is never a bad option. I think it would pair best with Void 3.0 and lead from gold builds." Recommended MW - Range.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

The two very close second and third are chill clip for Stasis oriented builds (or general add control builds), and frenzy for neutral damage across all enemy types.

//notes:pandapaxxy (PvP / M+KB / Controller): "Precision frames are some of the better choices for bows in PvP. Strident Whistle would need to have the lowest charge time of 576 to even compete in PvP. Fiberglass arrow shaft brings the accuracy back up after elastic string lowers it. Archer’s tempo is still great here, as is explosive head for double flinch. Moving target is a great pick if you feel you use your bow for follow up shots instead of bow-swap.

From the hugely popular Fatebringer to the fan favorite Dire Promise, from the OG Eyasluna to OG Austringer. Not even including the exotic kinetic hand cannons, DFA has a high hill to climb. The benefit DFA has over some of the other weapons is the possibility of getting adept rolls for the bonus masterworks and adept mods. This doesn’t entirely cover the fact that DFA’s perk pool just shipped underwhelming. Outlaw and rampage are tried and true but extremely boring.

// Forgiveness
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvP / Controller): "Forgiveness will be incredible in PvP. With a base air accuracy stat of 25, Adept Icarus adding +15, and Air Assault giving up to 60 as your health drops, you could have 100 air accuracy with rapid hit, ricochet rounds and a 17m effective range. [...] go for something like demolitionist for the added ability energy and multikill clip for the lethality. If you really like grenade builds in PvP and can secure those grenade kills then adrenaline junkie is the best pick for you. Some great neutral perks are moving target for the flat bonus to aim assist, and rapid hit to make securing that first kill easier." Recommended MW - Stability.|tags:pvp,controller

// Enyo-D
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Precision frame smgs struggle in PvE content. Both of the 900 rpm smgs just pump out damage faster, and aggressive frames hit like a truck while still maintaining a lot of that spray. Precision frames have the best base range for all smgs but comically low handling, reload, and stability. All three of which are important in PvE activities. Reload especially. Enyo-D comes equipped with feeding frenzy to circumvent the low reload, and fluted barrel will bump up that low handling. I like surrounded with surrounded spec for the best damage, but multikill clip coupled with feeding frenzy is a great option too." Recommended MW - Reload.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

Multikill clip is fine and good, but the immediate 33% damage bonus is incredible on any precision frame smg. Enyo-D also has less zoom than both. The zoom field has been condensed, but the 16 zoom smgs will still be some of the best out of the gate. Steady hands also brings up one of Enyo-D’s weakest stats and makes it feel incredibly fluid.

// Lunulata-4b
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Lunulata-4b is a great alternative in the kinetic slot. The clear choice is to pair it with any of the stasis builds, and you’d be absolutely correct. Polymer string and a draw time masterwork is all that’s needed to reach the draw time floor without sacrificing any accuracy. Lunulata-4b’s low accuracy stat of 25 means losing some would nearly drop you to the floor. Fiberglass arrow shaft brings the accuracy stat up to a respectable amount, but nowhere near perfect. The clear best perk is headstone, but having adrenaline junkie on a bow is fun. If you didn’t get one on a Fel Taradiddle then Lunulata-4b is your next best option.

To make the most of Lunulata-4b you’ll want to drop the draw time down to the floor.

//notes:Inspired by DMB PvE Podcast 25. PvE first-choice roll for end-game content. Adaptive auto-rifles are still pretty competitive as at S17 v4.1.5.2. In the same slot as Duty Bound or Scathelocke, which both have better Zoom, so you might need a touch of either range or stability, depending on preference, to compensate. Arrowhead Brake helps tidy up the wonky recoil and one of the Combat Effect magazines adds a little range and some utility effect. For end-game, particularly solo, content, it's difficult to top Demolitionist and Osmosis to give you an additional element to help break shields. Drops from the second (Hexahedron Room) encounter if you're looking to farm it.

//notes:Inspired by DMB Podcast 263 conversation with @illPhysics. PvP first-choice S-Tier roll for duelling. Originally a 150 Lightweight subtype that was rolled into the 140 Adaptive subtype, and suffers a little from being the only 13 Zoom HC in the sandbox. Stats make it very consistent feel - aim for stability and handling, to improve gunfeel, rather than range in barrel and mag.

// (Steadyhand HCS, Fastdraw HCS, Hitmark HCS), Ricochet Rounds, Opening Shot, Rangefinder
//notes:Inspired by DMB Podcast 263 conversation with @illPhysics. PvP first-choice S-Tier roll for duelling/blinting. Originally a 150 Lightweight subtype that was rolled into the 140 Adaptive subtype, and suffers a little from being the only 13 Zoom HC in the sandbox. Stats make it very consistent feel - aim for stability and handling, to improve gunfeel, rather than solely range in barrel and mag. Opening Shot give you an ideal blinting HC, and Rangefinder improves both your damage and aim assist dropoffs.

//notes:Inspired by DMB Podcast 264 conversation with @pattycakesGG. PvP first-choice S-Tier roll for kill-chaining. Not available as at S17 unfortunately, but arguably the strongest legendary PvP SMG in the game. Strong stats - almost auto-rifle range is possible. Push out the range as far as you can, even to the detriment of stability with barrel, mag and masterwork - this is a precision frame with 95 recoil direction, so it fires straight up and down, and a 16 zoom scope helps constrain bullet spread when ADS. Killing Wind adds a host of boosts including more range or Tunnel Vision adds bonus Aim Assist after a kill, at which point Kill Clip reduces both optimal and body shot TTK by 25%. Masterwork: Range, with a Sprint Grip or Quick Access Sling, if you're playing aggressively, an Icarus Grip mod to build on the already good Airborne Effectiveness stat, or a Targeting Adjustor for more passive playstyles.|tags: pvp, pvp-god, pvp-chain, controller, mkb

//notes:Inspired by DMB Podcast 264 conversation with @pattycakesGG. PvP first-choice S-Tier roll for duelling. Not available as at S17 unfortunately, but arguably the strongest legendary PvP SMG in the game. Strong stats - almost auto-rifle range is possible.

Precision frame, so recoil control is easier as the direction is pretty much vertical, and the 16 Zoom constrains bullet spread too. Push out range and zoom as far as you can with your barrel, mag and Masterwork, mixing in stability if you need help to control the recoil. Killing Wind adds useful stat boosts after a kill, and Rampage is probably the most useful second trait, to help out with chaining kills. Masterwork: Range or Stability, with a Sprint Grip or Quick Access Sling, if you're playing aggressively, or a Targeting Adjustor for more passive playstyles.|tags: pvp, pvp-god, pvp-chain, controller

//notes:Inspired by DMB Podcast 261. PvE first-choice roll. Shapeable. The Extrovert origin perk is most useful for CQC (within 15m), so probably not going to be that useful on a Rocket Launcher. Intrinsically offers 20% more damage over Precision Rocket Launchers, and the small blast radius may actually be useful with closer bosses (like the Caretaker). Increase the velocity with the barrel, add damage with Impact Casing, add Auto-Loading Holster so you can swap to continue damage with a sniper or slug shottie, and then Frenzy or Vorpal Weapon adds more damage on top.

//notes:Inspired by DMB Podcast 261. PvE first-choice roll for end-game content, for now! Shapeable.

Increase the velocity with the barrel, add damage with Impact Casing, add Auto-Loading Holster so you can swap to continue damage with a sniper or slug shottie, and then as at Season 17, Chill Clip seems to be bugged to add extra damage when someone on the fireteam is using a Gjallerhorn.

title:u/pandapaxxy's Guardian Games 2022 breakdown

// The Title
//notes:pandapaxxy (M+KB / Controller / PvE): "The Title is an interesting SMG. It's got some great synergy with different builds like the All for All, or grave robber and swashbuckler. Vorpal is always a good choice for general use, but I find SMGs can't really take advantage of it. If you have a good Funnelweb, you can make this work with different builds, but for overall usage I don't know if I'd take The Title over my frenzy Funnelweb."

// Sweet Sorrow
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "It’s almost a better Chroma Rush for majors while still having good utility in general content. This allows you to expand your loadouts and flex into kinetic (or stasis) special weapons while still having that good bullet hose in your back pocket. You seriously need to clean up the recoil direction so I think arrowhead brake is a must-have on any Sweet Sorrow you do end up keeping. [...] Triple tap and vorpal weapon together can help you shred some majors or champions, but the overall lower base damage leans me to recommending other weapons specifically for major killing. You can make it work but it’s not ideal." Recommended MW: Reload.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Sweet Sorrow
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvP / M+KB): "This is a fun situation where PvE and PvP mix. Arrowhead brake is still the best barrel, and I would recommend a counterbalance mod to get that recoil to 100 and give you the ease of use to invest into range or more consistency perks. The “big” damage perks on Sweet Sorrow don’t lend themselves to the PvP landscape, but one could argue demolitionist is a lethality perk, especially with current Void 3.0 grenades. Truthfully I’d try and make this weapon as consistent as physically possible and spec fully into stability. Autos are not in the best place, especially with their requirement of time-on-target for optimal TtK." Recommended MW: Range.|tags:pvp,mkb

//notes:pandapaxxy (PvP / Controller): "This is a fun situation where PvE and PvP mix. Arrowhead brake is still the best barrel, and I would recommend a counterbalance mod to get that recoil to 100 and give you the ease of use to invest into range or more consistency perks. The “big” damage perks on Sweet Sorrow don’t lend themselves to the PvP landscape, but one could argue demolitionist is a lethality perk, especially with current Void 3.0 grenades. Truthfully I’d try and make this weapon as consistent as physically possible and spec fully into stability. Autos are not in the best place, especially with their requirement of time-on-target for optimal TtK." Recommended MW: Stability.|tags:pvp,controller

// Under Your Skin
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "It’s arguably a better Hush. Successful warm-up in conjunction with archer’s tempo really drops that draw time to near-instantaneous speeds.

Le Monarche just got a wonderful catalyst in unrelenting, so you could potentially have a legendary lemon through dragonfly and unrelenting together. I do think the uniqueness of archer’s tempo and successful warm-up is a great combo, but for every-day play the combos of archer’s and dragonfly or explosive head, or adaptive munitions to rip through various shields is just a better play."

There’s a lot that can be done with this pulse, so don’t instantly scrap it." Recommended MW: Reload.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Redback-5si
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Sidearms in PvE are in a weird spot, while they have high damage per shot and excel in close range, you don’t always want to put yourself into those situations. The best perk for the Redback-5si is surrounded with surrounded spec, but that is a hairy situation to begin with. I would bump up its mag, range, and spec into reloader perks to maximize this sidearm’s usage, but I just don’t think it beats submachine guns, let alone autos or other longer ranged primaries."

// Redback-5si
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvP / M+KB / Controller): "While I love this archetype for PvP, I just cannot bring myself to like Redback-5si. Veist weapons feel good, I enjoy the archetype. But something about this sidearm just doesn’t feel right. It could be the lack of power behind its shots, hit registration being wonky, or just the sound not sitting well with me. But ultimately Redback-5si is an alright sidearm. Not having high-lethality perks is a downer, but I can get past that with better neutral perks. You want to push out its range without sacrificing other stats to try and edge yourself into submachine gun territory to find the best success." Recommended MW: Range.|tags:pvp,mkb,controller

//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Compulsive reloader has its best use when paired with reservoir burst to maximize uptime on that larger damage. Couple that with last season’s particle deconstruction and chefs kiss. Unfortunately we can only work with the seasonal mods we have now, so Snorri-FR5 falls off considerably, but still has great utility in double special weapons builds as the primary form of add-clear. Pair this with another special weapon that does good single target damage and you have yourself a build (heavy weapon optional)." Recommended MW: Reload.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Reckless Endangerment
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / PvP / M+KB / Controller): "In PvE there are just better shotguns, where a neutral, high-handling weapon just will not fit the bill. In Reckless Endangerment’s benefit is how smooth it feels to use. No other shotgun really comes close to how fluid this feels without any investment. [...] Crucible is where Reckless Endangerment can really flex [...] Having a shotgun that you don’t really have to invest in to make it feel fluid gives new players and people uncomfortable with PvP a shotgun to compete with. The obvious comparison is Riiswalker and I do think Riiswalker takes the cake over Reckless Endangerment in all forms of PvP. That being said, you can use Reckless Endangerment and hang with Riiswalker without feeling like a detriment to your team or yourself.". Recommended MW - Handling.|tags:pve,pvp,mkb,controller

In most cases that is entirely a meme, but against specific bosses it could be useful to have. A more utilitarian roll would be triple tap with vorpal weapon to slot in adept big ones when the grandmaster nightfalls release.

Arrowhead then becomes the only choice to really improve that recoil to something more desirable. Other options are then just to make the gun feel better.

// Empirical Evidence
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "It is good to see another aggressive burst sidearm back in the game. These have always been a hot topic within the community. [...] Empirical Evidence is just alright. Nothing flashy but also nothing bad. Just middle of the pack. With a better perk pool you could see this being a top contender for possibly end game activities. But Empirical Evidence’s perk pool just lets it down."

// Empirical Evidence
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvP / M+KB / Controller): "Within PvP the aggressive burst sidearms are extremely consistent. Swashbuckler will change the time to kill but even at lower stacks it will make it far easier to secure those three burst kills, or artificially extend your ranges. As long as you can maintain bursts on target this sidearm will do you well, not meta shattering well, but will definitely take some people by surprise." Recommended MW: Range.|tags:pvp,mkb,controller

// Forensic Nightmare
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Precision frame submachine guns are in a weird spot. Having higher damage but lower stats across the boards combined with a pitiful reload creates an awful feeling weapon. You can counter this with perpetual motion to boost some of the stats or grave robber to straight up bypass the reload, but you still have an uphill battle to fight with the gun versus using Funnelweb or similar that need a lot less to feel good."

// Forensic Nightmare
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvP / M+KB / Controller): "Forensic Nightmare has a really nice scope, but the zoom is a let down. Shayura’s Wrath is just an upgrade and most people have one in their inventory. Especially now with the alacrity origin trait. The only benefit to Forensic Nightmare over Shayura’s Wrath is the fact it is craftable, for those of us (like myself) who haven’t gotten a good Shayura’s Wrath to use. Kill clip and perpetual motion or slideways both have merit against guardians, and being a stasis submachine gun does open up your loadout to have more viable combinations."

// Ragnhild-D
//notes: (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "For the non-crucible members, our boy Reginald will feel good as either a major clearer or champ destroyer. One-two punch and frenzy are both incredible options that don’t need a lot to feel strong. Demolitionist can help with those grenades. Where assault mag isn’t as strong in PvP it can really help in PvE where the RPM bump can keep majors or champs staggered for just long enough to hit them with a finisher or keep up damage."

// Ragnhild-D
//notes: (PvP / M+KB / Controller): "This puts Reginald directly in competition with its energy alternative A Sudden Death. Both with elemental capacitor and quick charge hit 100 handling. Which can further be boosted by steady hands or perpetual motion. Which means you can completely forego handling in favor of more range for deeper clean ups. Range does not increase your one hit kill range, but will make it more consistent in those further ranges when needing slight damage. I’d argue investing into range would be a better pairing than assault mag as the RPM bump isn’t enough to even catch up to precision frames." Recommended MW: Range.|tags:pvp,mkb,controller

// Syncopation-53
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Syncopation is in an interesting spot right now. It competes with Eyasluna, the previous best headstone weapon while also being able to make crystals, but from further ranges. Being a pulse rifle puts it in a better spot for range and having multiple bullets per burst rivals hand cannon’s big single shot damage. The unfortunate part is no rapid hit to maximize the weapons feel, but it does have some incredible utility with stasis builds and general crystal shattering."

Syncopation doesn’t have anything to push it into the 2 burst realm outside of person buffs (empowering rift, inertia override, etc) but it does have utter consistency.

// Likely Suspect
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvP / M+KB / Controller): "In terms of PvP Likely Suspect falls off in comparison to Cartesian Coordinate. The two most important stats on fusions as of this current sandbox is zoom, followed by stability. Ideally stability through perks so you can also bump up things like charge time and handling. Likely Suspect does not have the zoom to compete with Cartesian Coordinate, but does have consistency through perks.

//notes:pandapaxxy (PvP / M+KB / Controller): "In terms of PvP the tracking is a nice feature but I wouldn’t count on it 100% of the time. It will either not track, track into a wall, lock onto the wrong person, or go right where you want it. [...] Having unrelenting and chain reaction can allow you to fire the rocket one way, get into a fight and get “random” healing when the rocket lands.

The two things that can bump up Father’s Sins in my book is the ease of getting one and crafting it to your liking, as well as having access to under pressure and opening shot.

// Herod-C (PvE first choice roll)
// Any barrel, Any mag, (Stats For All, Fourth Time's The Charm, Shoot To Loot, Perpetual Motion, Auto-Loading Holster), Miltikill Clip
//notes:Inspired by DMB Player Versus Enemies Podcast 11. PvE first-choice for general use. Not the strongest subtype, but worth tucking a roll in case High-Impact Frame ARs ever get some love. Gambit drop, with large perk pools, giving a 1 in 144 chance of getting the two perks you want in the last two columns, before even looking at barrels and mags. Choose barrel and mag depending on your Stability, Handling or Reload Speed preferences. There are really good options to improve weapon performance in the third column, and Multikill Clip is a good damage boost perk for non end-game activities. Recommended MW: Stability, Handling or Reload Speed, with damage-boosting (Minor, Major or Taken Spec) mod.|tags:pve

Maybe more PvP options with the traits, but Outlaw and Headstone provide a solid choice of weapon for stasis builds.

//notes:Inspired by DMB Player Versus Enemies Podcast 13. PvE first-choice roll for end-game use. Very good option for an arc energy primary weapon, particularly when there's an anti-champion mod to pair with it. Solid base stats, so your choice of barrel and mag, with Rapid Hit for a better feeling weapon on crit hits and and Timed Payload for flinch and bonus damage. Recommended MW: Handling.

//notes:Inspired by DMB Player Versus Enemies Podcast 13. PvE backup roll for end-game use.

// Arctic Haze - [YeezyGT's S16] (pve)
//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Range] "Arctic Haze is heavily, heavily slept on. With Overload ARs (and a rework) looming, a 20% Vorpal buff for primaries, some great perk options, easy farming options, and 720s generally shredding for CQC, I can foresee Arctic Haze being very viable (or at the least, very fun). Dragonfly is fun. Unrelenting is amazing in PvE now. The Recoil Direction naturally sucks, but it had to be reigned in somewhere." tags:pve

// Ancient Gospel - [YeezyGT's S16] (pvp)
//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Range] "Ancient Gospel can be fantastic - just its base stat package isn't great versus other options in-slot. If all the stars align, and you can nail down Accurized, Range masterwork, and a Range-oriented barrel, you're onto a very unique, very strong competitor. The slim perk pool is filled with great combinations (Eye of the Storm/Kill Clip, EotS/Rangefinder, Rapid Hit/RF, Rapid Hit/Kill Clip) that can make for a fantastic gun - its main shortcoming just stems from how you obtain it, being a random chance from one encounter in a non-farmable Raid that the casual playerbase isn't that keen on." tags:pvp

Dragonfly is never going to be boring. Outlaw is always great. There's not really a "best possible" PvE option for this thing due to how Hand Cannons perform in the higher-end PvE meta right now, so just take it for a ride and see if you have fun with it." tags:pve

// Avalanche - [YeezyGT's S16] (god-pve)
//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Stability] "Avalanche rolls with the tried-and-true combo of Extended Mag/Auto-Loading/Damage perk. Opt for Swashbuckler/Adrenaline for most content, Vorpal for higher-end, and Dragonfly if you've got a very high Stability roll that feels stable enough to reliably hit headshots. Avalanche kicks quite a bit on Console, but the damage it puts out once it gets going is fairly devastating to waves of enemies." tags:god-pve

// Riiswalker - [YeezyGT's S16] ()

You have a variety of good options in Quickdraw/Surplus, if you're someone who exclusively hip-fires, then Hip-Fire Grip is pretty strong too. Firmly Planted works mid-slide, so is more-or-less an ape's best friend."

There are so many viable rolls on this that your best bet is to just go out and try them - what works for you may be completely different to everyone else. If you want some guidance; Col. 2: [Ricochet for stats, High-Cal/Armor Piercing for flinch], Col. 3: [Rangefinder for Zoom, Perpetual for constant buffs, Rapid Hit for ensuring you win the fights you start], Col 4: [Headstone for Stasis, Kill Clip for slaying in sixes, Moving Target for Aim Assist].

Both have damage perks, or explosions on precision kills. One has a way to auto-reload (even while using, that can overfill to 150 in the mag), and the other does not. I believe the main edge Corrective Measure can have is simply in the Adept's ability to run Adept Big Ones Spec, which doesn't feel like a fair trade-off. Rewind Rounds could stand for a Subsistence-esque rework, as it doesn't feel feasible to reach the end of the mag in an LMG that often." tags:pve

Invest in Charge Time > Range > Stability in order of priority. If the Adept version were to return, Adept Charge Time could come in clutch here.

It's incredibly, incredibly unlikely you'll ever pin down a personal 5/5 roll (due to there being 12 potential perks... in each column), so I'd recommend going to town with one that ticks a few boxes for you and seeing if you can put in work. Explosive Rounds are incredibly strong on harder-hitting weapons, coupling with High-Cal due to the massive flinch they give off allowing you to challenge less-confident Snipers (and occasionally LFRs). The achievable range on Bottom Dollar is crazy, and if it matches your playstyle, you'll do very well with it." tags:pvp

//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Reload/Range] "One of the coolest, best-shadering Hand Cannons in the franchise, that's thoroughly under-appreciated due to a fairly stale PvE meta for 180RPMs lacking explosive ammunition. Honestly, there's a lot going for this gun in a 20% Vorpal buff, Rampage, Triple Tap, Subsistence, and even Threat Detector -- on top of that, Warmind Cell creation is still very much on the menu. I think if 180s were given a chance to shine (outside of seasons where they're an Overload damage type), the IKELOS_HC would see some great success." tags:pve

// PLUG ONE.1 - [YeezyGT's S16] (pvp)
//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Stability] "PLUG ONE has a large variety of perk playstyles that make it a little difficult to find a direction to go in. In general, you want high Stability (over Range, Stab = bolt spread), a lower Charge Time (tied to damage, so if you're not consistently one-shotting, you may need more) and either something that'll give you a constant helping hand (Under Pressure), or allow you to chain kills more easily (Heating Up). Backup Plan is great for a high-Handling build, and Kickstart for sniping as you enter into lanes. What works for you may be different to what works for others, so its worth trying out a few options." tags:pvp

Whereas Temptation's Hook (S11) has 46 Impact (considerably less than every other Sword), seemingly intrinsic to being a Caster Frame - Sola's has the regular 60, making it objectively stronger.

Invest highly into range, slide into a lane with Slideshot, and pepper with the range buffs and Timed Payload to force a disengage.

// Cold Front - [YeezyGT's S16] (pve)
//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Reload] "Cold Front's direct competition comes in the form of Extraordinary Rendition, with a better stat package, and the S-Tier SMG perk: Frenzy, which allows it to never worry about Reload Speed (+50!). Cold Front cannot roll with this, and its base Reload is pretty paltry. You need to stack (FlaredMagwell/Reload MW/Perpetual x2) on Cold Front only to still fall 10 Reload behind Extraordinary with nothing but Frenzy. The other option here is to run Surplus, which, if you're able to maintain 3 active abilities (difficult post-ability changes), then you'll match the Frenzy buff, but be sacrificing a slot where you would have had Subsistence. Cold Front's main edge is that it rolls with S+ Tier perk Surrounded (only 750RPM in-slot that can), but I really believe you'd have to force yourself to run an SMG Reload mod to be happy with it over Rendition. Or if you just prefer the gun, which... makes sense as well." tags:pve

Spike Grenades are a +50% impact damage buff, and with Backup Mag, Clown Cartridge + Demolitionist, there's a real chance of you being able to fire 18 times in a row without reloading or stowing your weapon.

Almost everything works here, but I've put just shy of 1000 Crucible kills into a Perpetual/Elemental Capacitor roll, which allows it to be the tightest bullet spread, with some crazy strafe speeds, and truly gives you the edge in most 1v1 fights.

//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Range] "The Multimach is a firm favourite of SMG aficionados in high-level PvP. While some farm for explicitly strict rolls, this recommendation has perks for those at different skill levels / platforms included. Typically, you'll want to maximise Range wherever possible, with Stability being crucial on Console, though not really a consideration on PC (opening up options like Iron Reach). Kill Clip is great if you are someone able to reliably chain kills, otherwise Iron Grip may suit you during the 900RPM adjustment period (huge Stability buff). Threat Detector comes down to personal preference - some players prefer a uniform handling experience, some appreciate the sudden buffs." tags:god-pvp

// Corrective Measure (Timelost) - [YeezyGT's S16] (pve)
//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Reload] "Corrective Measure suffers from "its not Commemoration" Syndrome. They're both Void 450RPM LMGs that come from farmable Raids. Both have damage perks, or explosions on precision kills. One has a way to auto-reload (even while using, that can overfill to 150 in the mag), and the other does not. I believe the main edge Corrective Measure can have is simply in the Adept's ability to run Adept Big Ones Spec, which doesn't feel like a fair trade-off. Rewind Rounds could stand for a Subsistence-esque rework, as it doesn't feel feasible to reach the end of the mag in an LMG that often." tags:pve

Whereas Temptation's Hook (S11) has 46 Impact (considerably less than every other Sword), seemingly intrinsic to being a Caster Frame - Sola's has the regular 60, making it objectively stronger.

If you're a triple GL fan like me, it means you can now run a full suite of Auto-Loading GLs, rotate an ALH Pardon with a Demolitionist Salvo for Atheon damage, or just simply have access to more varied Blinding Grenade builds. Ignition Code is stiff competition in this slot with a similar perk pool - I'd go for Pardon strictly if you're requiring ALH (which is its only edge vs. a well-rolled Ignition Code).

// Hung Jury SR4 - [YeezyGT's S16] (god-pve)
//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Any] "Hung Jury is a fantastic option for high-end content, rivalled in-slot primarily by Night Watch. It really comes down to personal preference - in general, Explosive Rounds on a Scout Rifle is fantastic, Rapid Hit is fantastic, Subsistence is fantastic... Hung Jury's a great workhorse and it can't really steer you wrong. Even on the Adept, I appreciate having a few more bullets in the mag with Backup Mag as I've always been an Overflow Night Watch guy." tags:god-pve

// Pointed Inquiry - [YeezyGT's WQ] (pve)
//notes: [YeezyGT's WQ] [MW: Handling] "Pointed Inquiry's main synergy comes in the form of Genesis + Adaptive Munitions/Turnabout. Shoot to Loot/Dragonfly has nice synergy, though with this 150RPM, I primarily see this as a high-level content, ranged-engagement weapon that you may end up using somewhat sparingly, if at all. Most perks should work here, though I'd rate it pretty low on the Scout Rifle food chain." tags:pve

// Cantata-57 - [YeezyGT's WQ] (god-pvp)
//notes: [YeezyGT's WQ] [MW: Range / Stab] "Cantata's taken the new season by storm. With access to S-Tier perks like Eye of the Storm / Opening Shot, Rapid Hit / Rangefinder, Vorpal swappables, Timed Payload for flinch, Moving Target for Aim Assist - there's something here for everyone. Invest into Range where possible when not using Rangefinder, and try to find the stability kick that works for you. Feels somewhat similar to Waking Vigil, which is a bit of an acquired taste." tags:god-pvp

// Duty Bound - [YeezyGT's WQ] (pve)
//notes: [YeezyGT's WQ] [Arrowhead / Counterbalance recommended] [MW: Range / Stability] "Duty Bound is another 600RPM Kinetic with very little fat in the perk pool - some great perks in Frenzy/Vorpal/Rampage/One-for-All, an Origin Trait similar to a bonus Unrelenting, and some consistency options in Perpetual/Zen Moment. The recoil does not feel great on console at all - I'd spec heavily into stability and recoil direction." tags:pve

A wave frame version of Salvo, which means you'll get way more shots off (no waiting for travel time), can point it at your feet, Souldrinker that heals you, Chain Reaction that essentially matches the Dead Messenger blast radius, its a Craftable, combo with Explosive Wellmaker and Well of Life to become unkillable as you run through trash adds like Thor, God of Thunder.

//notes: [YeezyGT's WQ] [MW: Charge] "Deliverance is a one-of-a-kind with an incredible suite of perks. It's difficult to recommend something specific, as there's a great deal of synergistic perk options here. Compulsive/Chill Clip is a Reservoir Burst-esque combo, without detrimentally increasing mag size. Cornered/Surrounded is a godly combo that cuts down Charge Time and massively increases damage output (Enhanced Surrounded + Spec is an ENORMOUS +47% buff), Demolitionist/Adrenaline Junkie have natural synergy, along with Demo/Chill Clip, Heating Up/Tap the Trigger, Perpetual Motion for consistency... Almost anything works here. Invest in getting that Charge Time down as far as you can while maintaining Range and bolt spread (Stability)." tags:god-pve

// Come to Pass - [YeezyGT's WQ]  (pve)
//notes: [YeezyGT's WQ] [MW: Stability / Handling] "As far as 360s go, Come to Pass feels pretty good. As a Craftable weapon, you have a number of options, namely being able to fine-tune the stability/handling for consistency, which I've always felt is the real barrier-to-entry for 360RPMs. Perpetual Motion is fantastic as always, Adaptive Munitions can help it become a workhorse for higher-level content, along with One-for-All, or spec into Dragonfly for, well, explosions." tags:pve

// Cataclysmic - [YeezyGT's WQ] (god-pve)
//notes: [YeezyGT's WQ] [MW: Charge / Handling] " The common thread with LFRs are: "Is it better than Reed's Regret?". Focused Fury was dismissed at first, but has turned out to be a valuable option for solo content, especially combo'd with FTTC (check out Prelapse's video on the LFR comparisons for more info). Ultimately, its nice to have more elemental options in your back pocket, as you never know what kind of synergies may come along with subclass reworks and matching mods (see: Font of Might)." tags:god-pve

//notes: [YeezyGT's WQ] [MW: Range / Stab] "Frontier's Cry does some interesting things, with access to some consistency perks like EotS / Rapid Hit, and also 3-tap potential at 180RPM with Kill Clip. Many will flock to Iron Reach for the huge visual Range stat bump, though I would recommend checking the breakdown on D2Gunsmith -- for 18 Range (roughly a 2m difference), you lose 27 Stability, which is very, very noticeable. The trade-off in-game is not as appealing as on paper. That being said, if you're investing heavily in Stability to offset it, it could be very nice to get the incremental range bump." tags:pvp

There's a number of options here, from consistency with Perpetual Motion, mag refunds in Triple Tap and Pulse Monitor (Enhanced Pulse Monitor is pretty crazy), and then damage boosters in Vorpal and One-for-All. It's actually pretty nice, and may even edge out Chroma Rush for me simply because a couple of these Enhanced perks play really well into bolstering 720RPMs, and Land Tank fits perfectly for the run-and-gun identity of the archetype." tags:pve

// Fel Taradiddle - [YeezyGT's WQ] (pve)
//notes: [YeezyGT's WQ] [MW: Accuracy with Elastic] "Fel Taradiddle is a great-feeling Bow to directly compete with Whispering Slab. As a Craftable, you can fine-tune it to be as strong as possible, which I believe to be (Elastic String, Compact for Reload or Straight Fletching for Accuracy, with an Accuracy MW). You have access to Archer's, Perpetual and Killing Wind depending on playstyle, and Explosive/Successful and Adrenaline Junkie. Whereas I believe Whispering Slab's Swashbuckler to be a stronger perk for Bows (with AJ having more grenade synergy on Energy weapons), the damage perk does not go unnoticed. Fel feels great, and it's definitely worth having one in your back pocket." tags:pve

// Forensic Nightmare - [YeezyGT's WQ] (pve)
//notes: [YeezyGT's WQ] [MW: Range] "Forensic Nightmare feels great, looks great, and has some stellar perk options. It's primary issue, however, lies in its 13 Zoom stat, which effectively castrates the gun. With a (base) max damage falloff of 15m, comparing to Shayura's 17 Zoom, 21.3m damage falloff... It's incredibly noticeable. There's some issues with muzzle flash here in darker areas too. Ultimately, I'd rely on the great perks Forensic has access to, and use it more casually. A shame that the Zoom stat neuters this gun, as even the Friction Fire has 16 for the exact same frame." tags:pve

// Recurrent Impact - [YeezyGT's WQ] (pve)
//notes: [YeezyGT's WQ] [MW: Reload / Stab] "Recurrent Impact is our first Stasis LMG. I like the idea of Enhanced Subsistence (up to +25% mag refund) and Headstone/Frenzy/OfA, I just always struggle with using Machine Guns that don't roll with Auto-Loading Holster. Like most 900RPMs, it feels great to shoot - hopefully in lower-level content you can keep chaining the mag with Subsistence so you don't have to suffer the base reload of 4.57s (wow)." tags:pve

You should definitely spec into stability and handling where possible to combat the sluggish feel of 360s, and then there's great options like Frenzy, Vorpal and One-for-All for higher-end content. Hakke Breach Armaments also combos fantastically with Headstone." tags:pve

If you're crouch/slide averse -- Perpetual or Heating Up are strong options here too. There's a careful balancing act for PvP Charge Time I won't get into (look up Castle Content for a full breakdown), but for PvE I wanted pure consistency at a distance outside of Rapid Fire's normal operating range, so Smallbore + Particle Repeater were my go-to's." tags:pve

// Piece of Mind - [YeezyGT's WQ] (god-pvp)

Consistency is king here, and its important to note the fine-tuning will feel different on console vs. PC (invest into more Recoil Direction on Console, whereas PC can offset this somewhat by investing further into Stability). Castle Content / Ivan F Karamazov have a great breakdown on how to fine-tune this for the best results. Definitely give it a watch if you're looking to spend some mats on this gun." tags:god-pvp

While maybe not a go-to for the higher-end PvE sandbox, it wins out on "cool factor", having wrested Rhulk's weapon that destroyed his home planet. A little cooler is Grave Robber's synergy on Glaives, with the Glaive melee fully reloading the magazine and nullifying any need to invest in reload perks. Swashbuckler currently only boosts the projectile damage, but the projectiles are a larger part of the Glaive identity we haven't fully realised yet. Currently, this is the only Glaive that feels good to me - but its still early days." tags:pve

// The Enigma - [YeezyGT's WQ] (pve)
//notes: [YeezyGT's WQ] [MW: Range] "There's a lot of Enigma fans out there. The common thread seems to be that Impulse Amplifier completely transforms the weapon, and that shielding/projectiles are a lot more usable than you'd think on the road to finding success. Some great options in Frenzy/Rampage, and then Unrelenting for those "oh shit" moments to trigger health regen on (projectile) kills. Grave Robber for the no-reload bros." tags:pve

There's a masterclass of perks here, with access to Perpetual/Surplus/Threat Detector/Pulse Monitor/Steady Hands, then E-Cap/Moving Target/Opening Shot/Frenzy/Vorpal. This is a slug frame I much prefer feel-wise to Heritage, closer to the more traditional gun styles from earlier in the franchise's lifespan. I'm sure most people will come across at least one roll that will work for them - it's a great gun." tags:god-pvp

// Red Herring - [YeezyGT's WQ] (pve)

It's good if you need a void rocket, and synergises with Volatile Rounds. Not a huge amount to write home about unfortunately." tags:pve

//notes: [YeezyGT's WQ] [MW: Reload / Range] "Funnelweb is everything we've ever wanted. Great stats, great recoil direction, the classic "Recluse"-style Veist frame, with the new Veist Origin Trait that randomly refills the mag mid-stream, Subsistence that refunds the mag on kills, and damage perks that can maintain near-constant uptime (Frenzy / Adrenaline). It comes at a perfect time, combining Void typing with Void 3.0's Volatile Rounds. There will be a good amount of people who pick this thing up, and then never put it back down.

// Insidious - [YeezyGT's WQ] (pve)
//notes: [YeezyGT's WQ] [MW: Stab / Handling] "Insidious is the perfect candidate for Crafting - a very rich perk pool with some great potential synergy, but with the need to fine-tune some things like Handling/Reload Speed depending on your perk choices. A PvE Insidious can have a one-of-a-kind (non-sunset) combo in Dragonfly/Rampage, though you're no longer benefitting from something like Rapid Hit / Heating Up, which are usually fixing your reload/recoil direction issues. Vorpal shreds Supers on this archetype, Demo/Adrenaline still rocks, Rapid Hit is perfect for 4-burst Pulses (and you feel the stability change mid-burst too) - there's a lot to love here, you've just gotta get the stars to align." tags:pve

//notes: [YeezyGT's WQ] [MW: Handling] "Palmyra-B is Izanagi's best friend. Auto-Loading Holster with Explosive Light is going to be your go-to for all your damage needs, unless for some reason you want to shoot all rockets consecutively, then you're after Impulse/Frenzy or Impulse/Explosive Light depending on orb usage (but likely another rocket altogether that actually rolls with Clown Cartridge).

// Thoughtless - [YeezyGT's WQ] (god-pve)
//notes: [YeezyGT's WQ] [MW: Handling] "Thoughtless is the secret DPS Sniper that we probably won't see properly utilised again until the next Raid race. With Enhanced Overflow, Extended Mag and Backup Mag, it maxes out at 17(!) in the mag, when paired with Font of Might, goes toe-to-toe with Izanagi's Burden. It's a bit more difficult to optimise swaps, but frees up the Exotic slot. Firing Line is the obvious option, though Focused Fury has a pretty low activation requirement, and allows you to use it solo / separate from teammates. That should come down to personal preference." tags:god-pve

// Explosive Personality - [YeezyGT's WQ] (pve)
//notes: [YeezyGT's WQ] [MW: Reload / Handling for ALH] "Explosive Personality is our new non-sunset Solar wave frame, sporting a bunch of decent perk options, and the benefits of being a Craftable weapon. Land Tank is a great Origin perk to have, especially for a wave frame where you are getting rapid kills in close proximity to the enemy. Unrelenting pairs naturally here, along with fast reloader perks like Threat Detector / Feeding Frenzy / Frenzy. There is currently an odd glitch (4 weeks into WQ) where this gun specifically does more self-damage, so can't be fully utilised shooting at your feet in the same way all other wave frames can." tags:pve

// Snorri FR5 - [YeezyGT's WQ] (pve)
//notes: [YeezyGT's WQ] [MW: Charge] "Snorri's the new kid on the block with a great perk pool. Firmly Planted (of course), Surplus as a reload booster, Heating Up for kill chaining, and the Omolon Origin trait that pairs fantastically with Reservoir Burst. Outside of that niche, Frenzy, HIRs and Successful Warm Up are all stellar options. Invest in the usual Fusion specs and Snorri should become a great workhorse for you." tags:pve

//notes: [YeezyGT's WQ] [MW: Range] "Ragnhild has some fantastic Handling-based options, with access to E-Cap, Frenzy, Steady Hands and Perpetual Motion - the rule of thumb here is to get as close to 60 Range as you can (Ragnhild maxes out at 60) for consistency's sake. That unfortunately results in the loss of Full Choke / Assault Mag options, if you want to get the full bang-for-your-buck in the OHK department. Ivan F Karamazov has a great breakdown on what works for this and why - definitely worth checking out before dumping your mats." tags:god-pvp

title:Season 15 Vanguard Nightfall weapons
notes:Reprised D1 weapons dropping from Nightfall completions

// Hung Jury SR4 (PvE first choice roll)
// (Polygonal Rifling, Smallbore, Fluted Barrel, Corkscrew Rifling), Extended Barrel, Rapid Hit, Explosive Payload 
//notes:Inspired by DMB Player Versus Enemies Podcast 2. PvE first choice roll for end game content. Rapid Hit more than offsets the Extended Barrel reload penalty, and Explosive Payload adds flinch and better anti-Overload Champion performance when that mod's in town. Recommended MW: Reload Speed or Stability, with Backup Mag or damage-boosting (Minor, Major or Taken Spec) mod.

Well, the same reason Eyasluna will be strong. Perpetual Motion. The handling from that coupled with opening shot will mean you can use your abilities and still have a fast handling shotgun. You can be on any subclass and still reap the benefits. It might not be the best in slot, but it will be consistent across any subclass across any build and any gamemode."

//notes:pandapaxxy (M+KB / PvP): "I do not know why everyone is so hyped by Quickdraw and Snapshot Sights on the 1kys. Quickdraw only works when you swap to the weapon with it, and goes away when you aim down sights or 1 second (whatever happens first). Unless you’re going for style points hot swapping to this sniper for montages the better choice is Firmly Planted. Firmly Planted increases accuracy and handling when crouched and activates on a slide. You do not have to stay crouched for it to be activated and could even crouch mid-gunfight for all the bonuses."

The slim perk pool is filled with great combinations (Eye of the Storm/Kill Clip, EotS/Rangefinder, Rapid Hit/RF, Rapid Hit/Kill Clip) that can make for a fantastic gun - its main shortcoming just stems from how you obtain it, being a random chance from one encounter in a non-farmable Raid that the casual playerbase isn't that keen on." tags:pvp

//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Reload] "Corrective Measure suffers from "its not Commemoration" Syndrome. They're both Void 450RPM LMGs that come from farmable Raids. Both have damage perks, or explosions on precision kills. One has a way to auto-reload (even while using, that can overfill to 150 in the mag), and the other does not. I believe the main edge Corrective Measure can have is simply in the Adept's ability to run Adept Big Ones Spec, which doesn't feel like a fair trade-off. Rewind Rounds could stand for a Subsistence-esque rework, as it doesn't feel feasible to reach the end of the mag in an LMG that often." tags:pve

It's incredibly, incredibly unlikely you'll ever pin down a personal 5/5 roll (due to there being 12 potential perks... in each column), so I'd recommend going to town with one that ticks a few boxes for you and seeing if you can put in work. Explosive Rounds are incredibly strong on harder-hitting weapons, coupling with High-Cal due to the massive flinch they give off allowing you to challenge less-confident Snipers (and occasionally LFRs). The achievable range on Bottom Dollar is crazy, and if it matches your playstyle, you'll do very well with it." tags:pvp

//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Range/Stability/Reload] "Fatebringer remains as one of the best-in-slot Primaries, for both PvE and PvP. There's a huge amount of customisation available on this, and I'd recommend trying a few out before going straight to Explosive/Firefly. Personally, Killing Wind/Firefly feels best to me, then Explosive/Frenzy for PvE. Explosive with Opening/Eye of the Storm/Kill Clip are your best PvP options. Any shortcomings you find with the barrel/mag, you're usually able to fix with the Adept mods." tags:god-pvp

// PLUG ONE.1 - [YeezyGT's S16] (pvp)
//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Stability] "PLUG ONE has a large variety of perk playstyles that make it a little difficult to find a direction to go in. In general, you want high Stability (over Range, Stab = bolt spread), a lower Charge Time (tied to damage, so if you're not consistently one-shotting, you may need more) and either something that'll give you a constant helping hand (Under Pressure), or allow you to chain kills more easily (Heating Up). Backup Plan is great for a high-Handling build, and Kickstart for sniping as you enter into lanes. What works for you may be different to what works for others, so its worth trying out a few options." tags:pvp

// Sola's Scar - [YeezyGT's S16] (pve)
//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Impact] "Sola's is one of two Legendary Caster Frames, and the only one of the two that matters. Whereas Temptation's Hook (S11) has 46 Impact (considerably less than every other Sword), seemingly intrinsic to being a Caster Frame - Sola's has the regular 60, making it objectively stronger. It makes you wonder whether this was intentional to give the Trials Sword significance, or they forgot that Caster Frames are supposed to be weaker. Either way, Chain Reaction's fun, Frenzy's strong, Vorpal is a good backup." tags:pve

// Cold Front - [YeezyGT's S16] (pve)
//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Reload] "Cold Front's direct competition comes in the form of Extraordinary Rendition, with a better stat package, and the S-Tier SMG perk: Frenzy, which allows it to never worry about Reload Speed (+50!). Cold Front cannot roll with this, and its base Reload is pretty paltry. You need to stack (FlaredMagwell/Reload MW/Perpetual x2) on Cold Front only to still fall 10 Reload behind Extraordinary with nothing but Frenzy. The other option here is to run Surplus, which, if you're able to maintain 3 active abilities (difficult post-ability changes), then you'll match the Frenzy buff, but be sacrificing a slot where you would have had Subsistence. Cold Front's main edge is that it rolls with S+ Tier perk Surrounded (only 750RPM in-slot that can), but I really believe you'd have to force yourself to run an SMG Reload mod to be happy with it over Rendition. Or if you just prefer the gun, which... makes sense as well." tags:pve

//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Range/Handling] "Uzume has a few PvE options in; Snapshot for general use, Clown Cartridge/Triple Tap for extended damage. Explosive Payload should be your go-to here, with the exception of if you're running Triple Tap / using against Barrier champs, then you should look at Vorpal. Or if you simply don't like Explosive Payload, Vorpal's the play. Invest into a Handling barrel if you're not running Snapshot, and prioritise keeping the magazine high if you're running Triple Tap/Clown Cartridge." tags:god-pve

//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Reload] "Interference VI was the heavy of choice for the World's First Solo Atheon by VoteforShifu - if that's not enough to make it worth using, I don't know what is. Full Court is great in (specific) circumstances, going up to a 25% explosive damage buff when firing from 50m(!) away or more, meaning you're ideally firing at a very stationary, very large target. Spike Grenades are a +50% impact damage buff, and with Backup Mag, Clown Cartridge + Demolitionist, there's a real chance of you being able to fire 18 times in a row without reloading or stowing your weapon. Very strong contender should Heavy GLs get some time in the limelight again." tags:god-pve

However, it does something Darkest Before can't - use an on-demand damage perk with Multikill Clip. Locking yourself into Rangefinder means that your effective range can outperform Darkest.

// Igneous Hammer (Adept) - [YeezyGT's S16] (god-pvp)
//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Range/Stability] "Igneous remains a top contender as a powerful 120RPM with a fantastic stat- and perk-package. The main change has been the move away from bringing out 2-tap potential via Rampage, to experimenting more with strafe speeds / better range dueling with Elemental Capacitor / Moving Target / Opening Shot. The right player can still run circles around 140RPMs at the proper engagement distance, and Rapid Hit massively simplifies hitting repeated headshots." tags:god-pvp

//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Handling / Stability] [Use Counterbalance Stock if you don't have Arrowhead Brake] "The BR may be the best-feeling gun I've ever experienced in Destiny. It's incredibly consistent, performs way outside of its expected range bracket, encourages playing off-angles and surprise plays, and can effectively counter shotgun-rushers in the mid-to-above-average-skill level. Almost everything works here, but I've put just shy of 1000 Crucible kills into a Perpetual/Elemental Capacitor roll, which allows it to be the tightest bullet spread, with some crazy strafe speeds, and truly gives you the edge in most 1v1 fights. For sixes, if you're a better player, Kill Clip instead of Elemental will make you unstoppable. Is the BR a meta-defining weapon? No. Is it viable? Yes. Is it fun as hell?

While Reed's has the edge for team play with Firing Line, Threaded has both Auto-Loading capabilities and access to Frenzy - a perk now often found superior to Vorpal in both damage, and the handling/reload buffs it gives. For solo play, any engagement where you're required to do damage away from 2 teammates, or where Auto-Loading becomes especially important, Threaded will still be the play here." tags:god-pve

Threat Detector comes down to personal preference - some players prefer a uniform handling experience, some appreciate the sudden buffs." tags:god-pvp

// Corrective Measure (Timelost) - [YeezyGT's S16] (pve)
//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Reload] "Corrective Measure suffers from "its not Commemoration" Syndrome. They're both Void 450RPM LMGs that come from farmable Raids. Both have damage perks, or explosions on precision kills. One has a way to auto-reload (even while using, that can overfill to 150 in the mag), and the other does not. I believe the main edge Corrective Measure can have is simply in the Adept's ability to run Adept Big Ones Spec, which doesn't feel like a fair trade-off. Rewind Rounds could stand for a Subsistence-esque rework, as it doesn't feel feasible to reach the end of the mag in an LMG that often." tags:pve

// Sola's Scar (Adept) - [YeezyGT's S16] (pve)
//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Impact] "Sola's is one of two Legendary Caster Frames, and the only one of the two that matters. Whereas Temptation's Hook (S11) has 46 Impact (considerably less than every other Sword), seemingly intrinsic to being a Caster Frame - Sola's has the regular 60, making it objectively stronger. It makes you wonder whether this was intentional to give the Trials Sword significance, or they forgot that Caster Frames are supposed to be weaker. Either way, Chain Reaction's fun, Frenzy's strong, Vorpal is a good backup." tags:pve

// Pardon Our Dust - [YeezyGT's S16] (god-pve)
//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Velocity] "This is the Grenade Launcher we've always wanted. A Kinetic slot GL that can roll with not only Auto-Loading (a first-ever), but Vorpal Weapon simultaneously. If you're a triple GL fan like me, it means you can now run a full suite of Auto-Loading GLs, rotate an ALH Pardon with a Demolitionist Salvo for Atheon damage, or just simply have access to more varied Blinding Grenade builds. Ignition Code is stiff competition in this slot with a similar perk pool - I'd go for Pardon strictly if you're requiring ALH (which is its only edge vs. a well-rolled Ignition Code). Also comes with Ambitious Assassin, and Perpetual isn't bad either." tags:god-pve

// Ignition Code - [YeezyGT's S15] (PvE): (god-pve,god-pvp)
//notes: [YeezyGT's S15] (PvE): [MW: Velocity] "So, it took me 250 Overrides to collect the rolls I wanted for this, like Thanos with the Infinity Stones. Generally; [Quick/Hard Launch / Spike/Blinding / Surplush/Slideshot/Ambitious / Vorpal/Demolitionist/Frenzy]. Ultimately, this is a fantastic gun, and the rolls are mostly personal preference. There's a lot of fuss over Slideshot, but you may ultimately decide it doesn't fit your playstyle - my personal recommendation is Surplus, as it feels a lot better to get into the reload-shoot rhythm to me. Slideshot for PvP, however."|tags:god-pve,god-pvp

// Age-Old Bond - [YeezyGT's S15] (PvE): (pve)
//notes: [YeezyGT's S15] (PvE): [MW: Stability] "If you're seeing this, you got an Arrowhead Brake roll - the solution to the curse that plagues most 360RPMs - horrible recoil direction. This roll will have near-vertical recoil, though still expect it to kick like a mule. Zen Moment / Dynamic Sway / Tap the Trigger thankfully make up half the pool here, and massively help control it. With Anti-Barrier Auto Rifle being the only option for S15, I'd fully expect better players to move to 360RPMs as a Scout Rifle replacement, and Age-Old Bond has the perfect mix of range and controllable recoil to make that work."|tags:pve

// Frozen Orbit - [YeezyGT's S15] (PvP): (god-pvp)
//notes: [YeezyGT's S15] (PvP): [MW: Handling] "This is probably the best-feeling Sniper in the game when it has high-Handling rolls. At 75 stock Recoil Direction, its near-vertical out of the gate. Arrowhead takes this to 100, more noticeable on Console. You have a lot of options with Frozen Orbit -- Surplus + Snapshot is stupidly fast. No Distractions + Opening Shot is a fan favourite for ensuring calculated headshots. Vorpal actually isn't needed, as you should one-shot headshot almost all Supers. High Impact Reserves if you're a body-shot bandit. The perk pool sounds like it would have been a great PvE option, but the mag size simply isn't there -- stick with Uzume."|tags:god-pvp

// Eternal Blazon - [YeezyGT's S15] (PvE): (god-pve)
//notes: [YeezyGT's S15] (PvE): [MW: ANY] "I've been hunting an Overflow/Disruption Break roll on this gun for so long, that Scouts don't even have a Champion mod anymore. Scopes are mainly personal preference, so I've listed all the short-to-mid-zoom options. Rapid Hit is fantastic here, Quickdraw feels really great too. Some people might be keen on One-for-All, though the mag size is a little restrictive on this to make use of it. Great feeling gun, lots of potential, very little competition as an Arc Scout Rifle."|tags:god-pve

// Love and Death - [YeezyGT's S15] (PvE): (god-pve)
//notes: [MW: Velocity] "Love and Death is fantastically versatile, and currently the easiest HGL to farm for, full stop. Pre-S15, this would have been the best future-proof HGL for DPS (should they ever be buffed), with the ability to stack your mag with Clown Cartridge, auto-reload, and sporting tied-highest Velocity for 150RPMs. You will [always] want Spike Grenades, at a massive 50% damage increase, then Quick/Hard Launch depending on your Handling preference. Full Court is great in theory, but inconsistent due to the accuracy at range required, so super situational. Demolitionist is great for auto-reloading mid-DPS, and Chain Reaction makes it a fantastic workhorse for general use. (tags: god-pve)|tags:god-pve

// Hezen Vengeance - [YeezyGT's S15] (PvE): (god-pve)
//notes: [YeezyGT's S15] (PvE): [MW: Velocity / Reload Speed] "If you're looking for the best Rocket, you've found it. Don't worry too much about Impact Casing, which ultimately amounts to a 3% damage buff. You'll likely want a few Hezen's for different situations, Overflow/Lasting Impression is incredible for sustained DPS, ALH/Lasting or ALH/Vorpal for Champions, Demolitionist is always great as a secondary auto-reloader, too."|tags:god-pve

// Accrued Redemption - [YeezyGT's S15] (PvE): (pve)
//notes: [YeezyGT's S15] (PvE): [MW: Draw Time] "Accrued Redemption is the only Bow that can run the insane combo of Archer's Tempo/Rapid Hit. If you ever wanted to feel what it was like to be Hawkeye, having those with a low Draw Time / Reload Speed will be the closest you will ever get. Outside of those rolls, Rangefinder acts like Impulse Amplifier's little brother, and Explosive Head is always fantastic in general, but specifically for Overload Champions. You can also combo Archer's Tempo + Explosive Head on this bow, which Biting Winds sadly cannot."|tags:pve

// Commemoration - [YeezyGT's S15] (PvE): (god-pve)
//notes: [YeezyGT's S15] (PvE): [MW: Handling / Stability] "Don't ever let me see you manually reloading an LMG. Stack up Reconstruction with a mag extender, and you've a match made in heaven. Rampage absolutely mows through enemies, Dragonfly if you want a little more flavour. The beauty of this LMG is how stable it is -- invest in Handling and Stability and you're onto a winner. Very Hammerhead-esque, but in a much nicer form factor."|tags:god-pve

// Empty Vessel - [YeezyGT's S15] (PvE): (god-pve,pvp)
//notes: [YeezyGT's S15] (PvE/PvP): [MW: Velocity] "God, this thing rocks. Not only does the little burst of flame on the explosion feel cool, the perk pool on it has insane potential. As always, Quick/Hard Launch, Spike (+30% dmg) or Blinding (utility). If you roll Auto-Loading Holster, congratulations. If not, Surplus is very good - and Quickdraw is fantastic for PvP / clutching with Blinding Grenades in GMs. Disruption Break is fantastic in PvP (if you want to be that guy), but a bit more situational for PvE. If you wanted Demolitionist here, I'd probably redirect you to Our Lord and Savior Salvager's Salvo."|tags:god-pve,pvp

// The Forward Path
//notes:Mercules904 (must-have PvP): "High aim assist, and good range and stability for the archetype are the main calling cards here, while range and recoil direction are the main drawbacks, but if you throw on a long zoom scope and a Counterbalance mod and give this weapon a shot I think you'll find it to be very strong. [...] All in all, this is a fantastic gun, a great kinetic companion to Summoner and Gnawing Hunger, and I expect it to be meta for as long as 600 RPM ARs reign supreme."|tags:pvp

// The Fool's Remedy
//notes:Mercules904 (pretty good PvP): "[...] the Fool's Remedy has great hip fire and in air accuracy by default, and the lack of reliance on crits to land a fast TtK has really given me a new strategy for dealing with apes, of basically jumping and/or hip firing and spamming shots into targets as they close, and it's proving to be surprisingly effective. [...] It might not be the best right now, but I still highly recommend giving this weapon a shot."|tags:pvp

//notes:Mercules904 (pretty good) - "A decent, easy to use sidearm that's very comparable stat-wise (almost across the board) to Smuggler's Word. I personally like to try to max out stability on these sidearms, being that I'm a console player and it's one of the archetypes defining weakness."

I definitely recommend trying to get one, but mostly to put in the vault until such a time as the non-Aggressive pulses get some of their range back (or Lightweights get a damage buff)."

// Jack Queen King 3 (PvP)
//notes:Mercules904 notes (pretty good PvP): "This isn't a great PvP gun on it's own, with Spare Rations being better pretty much across the board, but if you get a Subsistence and Rampage or Swashbuckler roll, I'd give it a shot for sure!"

// Traveler's Judgment 5 (PvP)
//notes:Mercules904 notes (must have PvP): "This is perhaps the gun I am most excited to get my hands on from the set. [...] Stat-wise the gun is straight up competitive, boasting very high base stability for a sidearm, and above average range, plus a decent mag size (equivalent to 10 bursts), and decent aim assist. Indeed, the only real drawback is below average recoil direction, and even that is manageable."
